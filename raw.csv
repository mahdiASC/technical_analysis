17047,,47,adrianwarholm@gmail.com,,,,N/A,(212) 300-7128,,"If money was not an object, I would go to Stanford to study computer science and engineering. This would be due to Stanford's location being in California. California is home to silicon valley and a major host of large and private corporations. It also is home to several developers and is notable for its developers. With this in mind, studying computer science at Stanford would be a perfect launch for my development career. With a notable school on my resumé and my location, job offers would be much easier to gain.

The only obstacle that would stop me in a world where money wasn't an object would be my ethics and ideas. I have to be motivated, professional, and produce items of value to be relevant and attain my goals. ","Last summer, I had two very important events. One was the development of a library with my friend. The library allowed us to manipulate GUIs with objects. Nodes, their properties, and the requested value were inserted as input to animate the GUI.

For example, if you pass an object as such: {Interface_Core, ""BackgroundTransparency"", ""Linear"", 0.5, 0, true};

This would tell the script to animate the core interface's background transparency/opacity to a value of 0 to be visible and wait until the animation was done. This required trigonometric functions and introduced me to a deeper understanding of the client's code.

The second was my involvement with the Youth Police Academy in the summer. I talked about internet safety, risks with the failure to secure important metadata, and threats online. The students felt it was intriguing and that really motivated me to continue my life as a developer. I found many actual took my words seriously and went ahead to mask their IPs from malicious sites or second-check downloads. 

It's important to me to help people and I enjoy doing so through code.","One time I struggled configuring an abstraction for my database. This was very complex as player information was at risk if I published this incorrectly to the actual game.

The issue was from the abstraction's functionality. Its purpose was to limit the save requests to the server, load data every time the player joined the game through a recursive formula that did not require me to hardcode the data, and check if I added any new fields to the existing datamodel it was referencing.

For example, if I had a multidimensional array of data that acted as a model of how I wanted the player's data to look like, the server would loop through this model and instantiate the data if the player was new.
If they weren't new, the server would simply get their existing data and instantiate it. 

However, a big issue was that there was a risk of data being corrupted due to the API used in association with the datastore and mistakes with my external code that could cause glitches indirectly. Another issue was what if I updated the game to have a new statistic or property for players[E.G. A new type of currency].

In this case, I had to check the data but only instantiate the missing indexes/properties. I added a recursive formula that checked the data instance in comparison with the datamodel. It would loop through every node and compare both parents with each other. If one was nil or unexisting, it would add or remove it[Remove if it wasn't inside the sample model the server is supposed to copy or add if there's a missing property/index in the sample model].

This made my game's datastore very flexible and a must keep for all my games. Simply because of the scalability of this code, any update I run on the game with the players' data will always update, be safe, secure, and never require the game to go down.","I prefer working as a team. This is a must in the developer world and also it's an educational experience. An individual can never learn new things by themselves. Everyone has different experiences and with this diversity, new ideas can be produced.

Hence, a team is must more efficient in progression, workflow, and is best for large projects. It also develops an individual socially. 

I love teams as we get to help each other and I get to say these words:

""I get to help you!""

This would be due to the fact that in a world where money was not an object, the only form of currency would be the exchange of ideas and products. I have many ideas and products to display myself as a viable asset for Stanford. The only issue that'd prevent me from reaching such a dream in that world would be the social connections I have with others. I may not have enough connections to gain all possible social benefits even though I have enough ideas to ""pay"" for Stanford.","Last summer, I talked to a group of students in the Youth Police Academy about internet safety. This was an important task as I informed the students about methods online predators could use to steal information or harm their victims. 

I talked on the stage with a microphone, talking about IP grabbing, denial of service attacks, password crackers and encryption. This was important to me as I got to share my knowledge with the team of students I was in and my younger peers. It was a moment where I could embrace my passion for computers for a good cause.","The first semester of Calculus BC was the hardest semester I took in my life. The pacing and algorithms that were required exceeded my limitations. I could barely keep up and was quickly falling behind. In order to fix this, I trained myself to keep on pace of my APs by managing my time better and practicing better studying habits. At the end of it all, I managed to get a 95 on a exam for the first time of the class - marking the success of my work.","I prefer working as a team as a team has many different individuals with unique ideas. I gain new insights from them and learn new things everyday socially and educationally. I also get to be part of a community where we have fun creating and worry less about workloads since they're all split.

In addition, a team strengthens one for the future as human are social creatures. The more we interact, the better we become due to our new experience.

","      If money were no problem, I would love to attend Columbia University. One of my main reasons has to do with where Columbia is located, the city. Although I live in the Bronx, I attend a school in the suburbs/rural area where I board and it wasn’t until my first night here where I realized how much I missed the urban community. A location where its always active and I never have to fall asleep to silence. Another reason I would like to go to Columbia is because they have a strong science program, specifically neuroscience which I am especially interested in. The brain is one of the most complex organs that humans aren’t even close to fully understanding which is why I’m so curious about it. There are so many uncovered secrets like how mental disorders come to be, why we can’t remember anything, and why we all have different perspectives and think differently. While I have been very invested in learning neuroscience, I have recently been focused on physics and astronomy. Learning about energy, speed of light, how far away we are from creating a man made object that can travel closely to the speed of light (right now the quickest man-made object is .0037% speed of light) all interest me as much as neuroscience so for that reason it is difficult to see what I will be studying at college. Other than finance wise, there aren’t any obstacles that can prevent me from completing this dream other than me. If I have a negative mindset and believe I’m not smart enough this will affect my decision of even applying to the program in the first place. Therefore keeping a positive mindset is the goal.","     This past summer I went on a trip with my brother, nephew, older sister, and brother-in law. In the trip, we went to South Carolina, Washington DC, and Philadelphia. Other than the fact that I had a bunch of fun and went to the beach, this trip meant so much to me because it helped me spend more time with my sister Andrea. Andrea is thirteen years older than me, so by the time I became more self-aware and conscience she was already out of the house. For this reason, I would see her but never got to really know her. I knew her favorite food, favorite color, favorite songs but not actually her. On this thirteen day car ride, I was able to converse with her about all kinds of things from politics to DC comics. Now I don’t see her as someone I share the same genes with, but a best friend and someone I can talk to. ","      Last year for my prep (9th grade) fall term, I took biology. This was different biology from my middle school, I call it “rich people bio”. I call it this because we don’t touch upon a subject and then have a quiz about what we remember, we spent weeks on the subject and did dissections and watched videos. However, “rich people bio” was extremely hard. For my first quiz, I felt very good about it but as soon as my teacher passed the quizzes back and I saw a five and an eight (in that order), I knew I messed up. The reason why I found it very difficult was the fact that we needed to remember hundreds of terms, explain them, draw pictures, etc. How was I supposed to know that I needed to study all of that for just a quiz? After playing around with different studying habits, I finally learned the importance of notecards. I would go through the terms the first time and separate the ones I knew with the ones I didn’t. Then, I’d study the ones I didn’t know until I was sure I knew it not memorized it, but actually knew it. Then I’d study the whole flashcards and repeat the routine with every assignment. With this, I was able to go from a C midterm to a B for my final grade.","      I used to prefer working solo because I thought working with a group would be “distracting”, however after realizing the purpose of a good group (kids trying to reach the same goal as you), I understood the importance. When working solo, I’m limited by my knowledge and understanding of things. Therefore if I’m on a problem I find difficult, doing the same strategy over and over again because I don’t know any other way, doesn’t help. With a group, you have many kids with many backgrounds and many different understandings. So it’s not just one person tackling a problem in their way.

I’m currently participating in an Accelerated Learning Academy studying Biomedical Engineering and Technology. To further expand my knowledge in Computer Science, I am also enrolled in the SI.min course. This introduction course has deepened my interested in the Computer Science field. Overall, attending the All Star Code Summer Intensive program will allow me to broaden my technology knowledge while also receiving mentorships, college guidance and networking.  ","If money wasn’t an object I would attend either Massachusetts Institute of Technology or Cornell University. Based on my current interest I would study in Engineering. In doing research both colleges offer an exceptional STEM program, which correlates with my passion to have a career in the STEM field. The only obstacle I see preventing this dream, is the acceptance rate is extremely high. Applicants from across the country would apply to these schools. Therefore, it would be very competitive to be accepted into these top-tier colleges. Will it be easy? No, but hey I’m still going to try.","Last summer, I attended the W.E.B. DuBois Scholars Institute. This was a 5-week intensive program at Princeton University were I studied Management & Business Academy. I learned the principles of business management and entrepreneurship. During my stay, I was also exposed to leadership principles and African American Studies. By attending this program, I gained a wealth of knowledge in business management skills and ethical business practices. More importantly, I personally gained self-knowledge, a strong sense of social responsibility and leadership skills while having fun meeting teens from different states and backgrounds. I must add it was also my first experience being away from home for an extended period of time and I grew as a young man.","This past year, I have been struggling in math. I’m currently enrolled in Pre-Calculus Honors. At my school, I’m considered to be in an advanced math for my grade level. Although, I was able to make the honor-roll, it was a struggle because math has always been the easiest subject to me. I’ve always gotten an “A” without really having to study. Pre-Calculus Honor is another story. I’ve gotten the lowest grades in Math.  I was not satisfied and had to get out of my comfort zone thinking I got this and seek help. At school, during my free periods I go to the Math Lab for assistance.  I also have a math tutor for test refreshers to help boost my grade up.

The topic is a middle path between computer science and biology, both subjects being of great interest to me, where it combines and utilizes methods in computer science to make simpler the study of life more efficient. I learned about this topic in my sophomore year, when my computer science teacher assigned us a term paper regarding applications of computer science in real life. This topic greatly interests me because it combines both my favorite subject, Computer Science and Biology, and can prove to be very useful for future generations. For example, bioinformatics was used to help create microarrays, which help detect mutations early on in cells. This could prove useful to help prevent cancer and other diseases. This line of work really interests me and I would like to study down this path. Some obstacles that may be preventing me from achieving this dream are my grades. I don’t believe that I have the grades necessary to be able to get into one of the top IVY league schools at the moment. However, if I strive this term, I may be able to bring my GPA up to be able to be accepted into Harvard Medical School.","Last summer, I got a job tutoring this girl in math and other subjects that she was expected to learn in her upcoming school year. The student’s name was Cassandra and she was entering the 5th grade after the summer. I was able to efficiently and effectively teach her the proper ways to solve each problem and how to creatively think her way through problems. This job really inspired me to realize that I have the potential to teach and educate the kids in the community around me, so that it can lead up to more well-educated children who also desire to give back to their community. Growing up in the Bronx, my community was very tight-knit with immigrants who have just arrived into America, and their First-Generation Children. These children, including me growing up, couldn’t really rely on their parents because they weren’t educated or even fluent in English. They were forced to learn an entire culture, language and education all by themselves with no help. That’s why I hope to inspire kids in my community to grow up to be brightly educated. I also hope that my hopes of going into the Computer Science field, will spread onto other children so that they’ll also desire a career in Computer Science. In modern society, not a lot of people settle on majoring in Computer Science. If enough kids are introduced to computer science at an early age, there may be an entire generation of Computer Scientists rising up for the future.","A problem I struggled with was creating a Web page for a project in my computer science class. The assignment was considered our final and was worth around 10 percent of my grade, so it was important that I had to follow the assignment’s details correctly and carefully. The assignment had to deal with using HTML to design a web page about yourself, with decorations showcase our personality. This was one of the hardest tasks in my computer science because we were all fairly new to the language of HTML and how it works. I couldn’t figure out how to perform a lot of requirements included in the rubric, which included making a table and incorporating multiple pictures. We didn’t learn half the material necessary, so it was very difficult for me to do. In order to solve this problem, I went to my teacher for a one-on-one meeting. He showed me an example of how students from the previous year's accomplished the task, and was able to answer each and every one of questions on how to create and perform different actions in HTML. I had to solve this problem by relying on another person, my teacher. I believe that the best way to solve something the right way is to ask and learn how, since sharing knowledge is one of the most effective ways to help someone.","I prefer to work as part of a team, because there are a lot of benefits that come from working in a team. Being on a team implies that there are multiple people that can all contribute and make the task be efficiently and exponentially faster to complete. It also allows multiple brains to come together to help solve a problem together. As members converse, different members tend to contribute different ideas and solutions to the problem. Being on a team also implies that there are several other teams that are competing alongside with you. As a competitive person myself, I like rushing to problems and solving them quickly, so that I could get the satisfaction of winning over the other teams.

Nonetheless, assuming everything would become affordable for all, I would try to take maximum advantage of my education. The question is: where would I go?
To begin with, merely viewing which university ranks first is not enough. Behind those rankings lie even more statistics which are not represented (such as major of choice, chances of receiving a job, student life, etc.).
The smarter approach? Deciding what I want to do in life and seeing which college most aligns with my vision. Since young, I've always wanted to start a startup. The challenges and roads involved in the process of building a startup always fascinated me. The best college for students who want build their own business, according to Forbes, is Stanford University. And that's where I have the highest chance of succeeding so that's where I would like to go.
(Yes, other factors do play a role, but if it were based on education alone, then Stanford is my top choice.)","Last summer I joined STEM Summer in the City. I worked on building robots, urban planning, making friends, and learning how to manage teamwork efficiently.

I would study computer science because anything could be done with the power of programming. Computer science is a unique field as it requires one to critically think outside of the box to accomplish a specific task. It is something that is incorporated with things that we use every day without evening realizing or noticing it. Besides, computer science has a huge outlook as it is need in every industry. Obstacles that might prevent me from achieving my dream could be bad peers and poor high school preparation. Peers are essential and truly important not just in college but also life in general; however, they also have disadvantages and a negative side. Choosing correct peers is crucial and critical and choosing one can be difficult. The negatives of bad peers are that they can be bad influences which could lead to peer pressure. But this obstacle can be overcome by effort of find correct peers. Another obstacle could be poor high school preparation. Not all high schools are the same with the same teachers or classes. One school might have a teacher or class that does not prepare a student to excel in college by providing the essential information. This could also be overcome by determination and good work ethics. Anything can be accomplished with determination.","One thing that I did last summer that was extremely important to me was attending the Technology Student Association National Convention. This was really important to me because it taught me something that is essential to become successful in life, leadership. The purpose of Technology Student Association is to enhance technological literacy, compete on local, state, and national levels, developed and enhance leadership skills, and to network with leaders around the world. I achieved exactly that! I enhanced and developed new leaderships skills by attending several seminars and workshops, I competed in STEM based competitions, and I also met numerous leaders around the world who shared their steps on how to become successful. This was truly something important to me as it motivated me to become successful and a leader.","A time I struggled to meet my objective was when I competed for an award, Best Position Paper. This award is given to delegates of Model United Nations who attend the conference. In order to be the victor of this award, delegates must illustrate their knowledge of the agenda topics at hand, affirm the positions their country takes on these topics, and recommend courses of action to effectively address contemporary global problems in the form of several formal papers; however, the troublesome part was particularly not constructing the paper but constructing the paper on top of maintaining school work and additional work. I had to miss a couple of days from school since this conference was held during school. As a junior taking honors classes, Advance Placements (AP) courses, and Career and Technical Education (CTE) course this wasn’t an easy task. I was burdened with an abundant amount of work that had to be met an upcoming deadline. Sure, I could have easily not done the paper and miss the opportunity to obtain this award. But I wanted to make my committee, team, school, adviser, parents, and myself proud. I was ambitious and determined to finish all my mandatory school work and compose papers for the conference. I did whatever it took. I stayed up as late as 3 o'clock am and woke up at 5 o'clock am to attend the conference, where I relentlessly debated global topics. At the end of the day, I completed both task as I won the award and made my committee, team, school, adviser, parents, and myself proud.","I prefer working as a team because I believe it is efficient and brings a collaboration of ideas. Being in teams brings people with different backgrounds, ideas, and experiences into a group. I believe teamwork is better than working alone or solo because working as a team consists of a group of people working cohesively toward a common goal. Within that group, there is strong team environment where members support one and another. Motivation is a huge aspect to teamwork as it strengths morals of the team to strive for the better and to complete the task. I believe teamwork is highly efficient as different individual strengths combine to proficiently enhance team perform. Another reason why I prefer teamwork is because of the collaboration of ideas. Collaboration brings in creativity and the sharing of unique ideas. It also allows sharing of variety of suggestions openly.

I hope to continue in this field of work when I enter college.","I would go to Harvard and study Computer Science or Psychology.  These are two things that are very different but they have interested me for a very long time.  When I play video games, I start to wonder about how certain things run and how they are made.  I currently take A.P Psychology and the topics are always interesting such as “How Do We Learn” or “How Does The Brain Work?”  I want to study something that makes me think and question things that have been considered “facts” for a very long time. Harvard is probably a common answer to this question but I would genuinely go to Harvard and study anything that I can.  I would commit to anything that I can.","Last summer, I was a part of a business program called Youth About Business.  I went to this program because my father always tells me to a well-rounded person and this program helped me become a well-rounded person.  I stayed at Columbia University and fully experienced the college life such as staying in dorms and traversing the campus.  I even had my own I.D.  In the program I learned how to start a business and get it out of the early rough patches.  For the final part of the program, I had to pretend that I was buying another company.  I had late nights searching for information on both companies and this gave me the trait of perseverance.  I stuck through and completed everything that I had to do.  It was really a one of kind experience.","A good example of when I struggled would be in my Trigonometry class.  I had a project that took me very long to complete. I am a good writer thus, the essay was relatively easy but the the actual model was difficult.  I had to build a bridge using all kinds of formulas and I kept failing every time I thought I had a good idea. I eventually made the bridge out of popsicle sticks, glue and a shoe box.  I got through by just persevering and staying calm thought the many hours I stayed up.  I took my time and remained patient.  People always tell me that I have a lot of patience and I’m very mature.  I used that mature attitude and didn't give up and accept defeat.","I can do both.  I have worked in a team during Youth About Business and I have worked by myself in New York on Tech and I have done perfectly fine in both of those programs.  When I work in a team, I usually take the role of a leader or maybe the person who is always trying to find new ideas and give a new perspective to a problem.  When I work solo, I am able to concentrate a lot more and maybe get more work done in a shorter span of time.  They both have their pros and cons.  I have no preference.

Additionally I feel that learning to program will improve my problem solving abilities and it will allow me to create cool things like apps.","If money were no issue, I would like to attend a college like Binghamton and I would probably study something like Bio Chemistry or Neuroscience because I am interested in being a surgeon. But then again I am intrigued by computer science and perhaps if I learn more about it, I will change my mind. The time commitment might pressure me to give up pursuing medicine, but I will try my hardest to not let that happen. I understand that the journey to a surgeon will be long and probably very painful, but I will endure.","Last summer I was occupied with the Opportunity Network, a very prestigious six-year program that prepares me for college and helps me find internships to enrich my resume. We had Summer Institute, which is basically a series of classes and a field trip we take in preparation for the upcoming school year. I really cherished my experience at OppNet because it allowed me to meet a diverse amount of teenagers my age who I quickly became friends with. ","Math has always been my worst subject, I have struggled with it for a long time. I used to play a lot of video games a few years back and these would take up a huge chunk of my time, time that I could instead have used for studying and improving my abilities in algebra or geometry. I realized that in order to improve I needed to sacrifice and give up video games, but it was a good decision. Now I no longer struggle with mathematics and have been able to improve my grades in algebra, geometry, and algebra 2/Trigonometry.","I prefer to work as a team, because this allows you to tackle on big problems with ease.

I went to visit the school with my sister, a junior now applying for college. I immediately fell in love with the campus and its location in Massachusetts. The small community there is also very appealing to me because I like the idea of being close to, or at least knowing, everyone who I go to school with. This interests me much more than a larger college with thousands of students per grade. I feel like the teachers would be able to form a much better connection with me and vice versa because the teacher to student ratio is much lower than a larger college. A stronger bond with a teacher could perhaps help me in the future if I need a mentor. At Amherst, I would study biology and neurology, hopefully getting closer to achieving my goal of becoming a doctor. I can’t imagine anything stopping me except myself, and I won’t let that happen.","This past summer, I went to Haiti for the second year on a dental mission. We went on a mission with the Gaskov Clergé Foundation in Les Cayes Haiti, where we provided free dental care to those who couldn’t afford it. Every morning we would wake up at 7 am and take an old van through the bumpy, winding roads of Les Cayes and set up the instruments and tools at a nearby clinic. After each instrument was used, I would put them in an alcohol sterilization bath and prepare them for our next patient. I would also help the head dentist with amalgams which are metal fillings and tooth composites. I had an opportunity to experience something that only med students would probably have the chance to. This trip was very important to me because, being Haitian, I feel like I lose touch with my roots living in the bubble of New York City, and visiting Haiti somewhat humbles me. It makes me feel lucky for what I have, and see what people living in poverty have to endure.","In 9th grade, I had a writing assignment due. It was an essay on François Duvalier with which I was having great trouble writing. I couldn’t find enough sources and I didn’t know how not to make it just a biography of his life but rather an analytical essay of his politics and life. I finally met with my teacher who provided me with insight which helped me understand how to incorporate certain things into my essay which I previously was struggling with. I was able to finish the essay on time instead of asking for an extension, and did very well. She taught me how to think outside the box with writing instead of just thinking about it linearly. In doing this, she helped me improve my writing especially with analytical essays which is now much better than it was a year ago","I prefer to work as part of a team. I think at times I struggle with coming up with ideas, but being in a group and brainstorming helps my best ideas come out. I also feel like I can produce better work, and work more efficiently when I am in a group of people who motivate each other and make all of us want to work harder.

First, I would like to say that I want to study at U Penn because I greq up in Pennsylvania for 3 years in my life and I would love to go back.

Now, I emphasize that I would only do this if money is out of the picture. This is because philosophy, a study that mainly revolves around unconventional and irregular thinking, is a fairly unreliable collage major to get a job in such a objective and systematic world. In other words, philosophy my enrich my mind, but not my stomach. 

Once again, if money is out of the picture, I would study philosophy, becauce, unlike studying in other fields, where the knowlege learned can only be applied in such a limited field, philosophy can encompass all fields of study, since the knowlege gained is merely ""how to think"".

So, if one knows how to think, then he, regardless in which field, whether that is medcine or computer science, can thrive, because all knowlege in the end comes down to one purpose -- problem solving. If I can master the technique of problem solving thorough creative thinking and innovative techniques, then I can live with nothing  unconquerable.","Last summer, I went to China. As pleasant as the trip was, it stood out to me that many people in China have no self awareness. Why were some individuals so uncivil? Cutting in lines and pouring dirty waters on the street. I thought about this on my flight back, and realized that it is all a matter of self awareness. 

Do you think you are a bad person? Of course not. Although we realize that we are all imperfect, we always have trouble seeing where our imperfections are. Same with the ""uncivil"" men in China. Do they see their actions as unacceptable or flawed? The answer is no. ""Bad"" people in life are not bad because they want to be bad, unlike antagonists in comic books such as the Bane or Venom, it is because they thought what they did was perfectly normal. 

This was a revelation to me. I made me understand that maybe the things I say or do are just as ridiculous as those done by the Chinese man. So, I must always listen to other's advice and constantly look myself in the mirror to reflect my flaws and, hopefully, improve.","I remeber the difficult time during sophomore year, when I had to take Chemistry. The course was a jumbo mess, I did not know what the teacher is drawing on the board nor what these energy levels are; it did not click. After my first two tests, both around 70s, I realized that someting need to change; I need to improve. 

First I tried doing the homeworks more carefully, understanding more than I need to on the topic by searching online and reading on Wikipedias. Chemistry homework session almost double because of this extra learning. I tried asking questions more often in class, working with classmates more, and getting better sleep at night (to stay awake!). All this hard work finally paid off; I got my first above 90 grade on my Chemistry test -- a 94 -- I think it was the unit on intermolecular force. Through this, I learned that hardwork, especially overwork, although sometimes seems overrated and unnecessary, is definitely worth it in the end.","I prefer working as part of a team, despite the issues that come with it.

This kind of world is quite unimaginable as we live in America which is a capitalist money-making machine. Nonetheless, I would go to MIT, or Cornell University. These two have top engineering and programming schools in America and provide excellent resources for researching and studying the topics I love. Now technically, resources are based on money, and if money didn't exist, all colleges should have the same amount of resources. I remember my first attraction to engineering was going to my father's job one day. I remember just staring at him designing buildings on his computer and imagining it in real life.

If money were no object, I would be able to go to the best of the best and study these subject so that I can learn as much as possible and be more productive in society. If money were no object, then my only obstacle would be myself. Even with money, your self is a major impediment. If anything, it is a good thing money exist, because many people only go to college on the premise of getting a job when you get out. But in a world of money, the only goal is money, and it is possible to forget that life isn't about money but about helping others and empowering society.","Last summer I did a biology program at Harlem DNA Lab where we studied E. coli. Even though it sounded disgusting at first, it turned to be rather interesting. We genetically engineered antibiotic resistant bacteria. It was a lot of work and new things to learn quickly, but nonetheless a high dive into the science of cellular biology. I was motivated to join this program because my national honor society program in my school had told me about it, and also because I wanted to diversify my skills. I feel it is important to take any opportunities that are given because it only helps you. Learning more ensures that you will be ready for the real world, and it is better than doing nothing all summer. All Star Code grabbed my interest even more due to the coding and leadership skills provided, which are two needed competencies in this day and age.","One problem I had was in 7th grade taking the geometry regents. When school was almost over, there was talk about classes for high school. In Medgar, in order to take physics, you had to take geometry first. I wanted to take physics in 8th grade, but I had no way of taking a geometry class. But, there was a geometry regents in the august of that summer. I saw that if I were to take the regents, I would only have 2 months to learn all of the material. I was determined to take the regents, though. It was hard sacrificing beach days and parties to study something that wasn’t necessary, but would help me. I decided to make it my duty to learn and pass the geometry regents. I took it and passed with an 86, but as I look back I wonder why I did all of that. I didn’t have to take physics in 8th grade, but I made the opportunity mandatory for myself. Every time I do this in school, and in life, I do better. I scored a 93 on the physics regents with this mindset. I think this same drive will help me in a long run, and in this program. I will make it my duty to learn what ever this program teaches, and have fun with it. I know everyone in All Star Code has this mentality and I would be honored to work alongside them.","Team work makes the dream work. This very true when everyone is on the same page, and are given equal share of the load, and care about the end goal. Working as a group is not only helpful to the overall product, but also allows the individual to communicate, and see different perspectives. As we know, life is not singular, and not everyone thinks the same. Working as a group allows different perspectives to be shared, and those individuals in the group to learn more ways to think.

With no financial restrictions, there'd be nothing to stop me from my goal except myself. 

I would be motivated to go for a PhD in Computer Science and Computer Engineering as I would be able to afford that many years of college. I love computers and I'm very passionate about making beautiful, short code that works efficiently. I also like creating code that anyone can use and is revolutionary.

It's amazing to help people - and coding allows me to do this through a unique way.","Last summer, I helped design an API with my friend online. Using Atom, we created a javascript library that animated HTML elements inserted into an array. 

This project was highly important as it meant the complete change of our project's development. We had an API doing so much for us that it made me look at the development world in a different way.

I learned that even though you shouldn't reinvent the wheel, you should always find a cool way to redesign it.","I struggled with creating a self-sustaining, autonomous database. Basically, any time a fatal error occurred with a player I wished to have the database reset the user's data and load in the older data. I also wanted it to check if I ever added new indexes to the datamodel with new properties and update the player's data to get the most recently added index.

The issue was making this short, concise, and reusable. I am someone who dislikes code that I can't reuse for other projects. I wanted this database system to be so flexible that I could use it for any of my games that used Lua.

In this case, I sketched out the entire layout of my program and how to integrate it with my libraries and API. Turns out, my planning and my understanding of data algorithms allowed me to think of a recursive formula to quickly instantiate data via a loop. I could also recursively update recently added data from the sample datamodel, delete it, and handle errors when the database was down.","I prefer to work as part of a team. Teams allow individuals to gain insight onto the reality of their projects. Each member gives constructive criticism and perspectives that allows everyone to learn - no matter the gap of experience between them. This is because we are naturally limited to our own experience and each experience is unique.

A team is composed of unique individuals of unique experiences. Thus, there will always be a chance for a unique, innovative method to manage a project. The creativity, education, insight, friendships, and potential are all benefits a team has that an individual can lose.

Hence, a team is my prefer method of working.

I would like to go to a university where students are allowed and encouraged to take courses at all of the different schools. Right now, I am interested in studying computer science, chemistry, math, and perhaps physics. These are subjects that have always interested me and that I enjoyed taking in my time so far in high school. 
I like to think that I won’t let any obstacles stop me from achieving this dream, but the reality is that finances will limit the schools that I can apply to. I know there are some great schools that have very generous financial aid programs, but there are many others that might require getting into very deep debt in order to attend, which I do not think is a good idea. This might seriously shrink my options when it comes time to apply to colleges.","Last summer, I volunteered for the Jimmy Fund, an organization that raises funds for the research and treatment of cancer. On every day of the weekend, I would go to a movie theater that supported the Jimmy Fund, which I fortunately lived very close to, and ask moviegoers for donations to the fund. One of the things that I have always enjoyed is being useful to other people and causes, so helping a cancer institution was very appealing to me.
	That summer, I also worked on learning GameMaker studio, as I had always dreamed about what it would be like if I made my own game. I began construction of a game called “Donald Trump’s Piñata of Lies,” which provided examples of the more ridiculous falsehoods that Trump told and fact-checked them, in the context of a game in which players would click pieces of candy. Working on the game was important to me because I wanted to learn more about constructing a game and because I wanted to do something to help promote facts over falsehoods.","	For most of my life, I struggled with meeting and talking to new people. I had never learned how to start a conversation, so whenever I sat down with someone during my lunch period, it always resulted in 45 minutes of silence as I tried to think of something to say. Once it got to the point where I would sometimes eat my lunch on a staircase to avoid in the cafeteria, I realized that this was a problem that had to be addressed. I decided that the best way to help myself talk to other people was to force myself to, so I joined my school’s Junior Statesmen of America afterschool program, where I would have to stand up and debate my views in front of other members. Since then, I’ve enjoyed going to meetings and talking and debating with other members, and it has helped me come out of my shell.","	Personally, I prefer to work on some projects as part of a team and on other projects by myself. Teamwork allows large assignments to be completed faster by distributing work between group members and allowing each member to focus on one part of the assignment. Working in a team also allows people to share ideas and possibly come up with something better than any one person could have done on their own. However, I also look forward to doing projects by myself so that I can learn every part of the project myself, and try out my own ideas.

I hope that participating in this program will help me learn computer science and also revive my memory on some computer science languages that I have learned before but ultimately forgot. I have learned python, javasript, and java and i hope that this program challenges my critical thinking and helps me achieve a proficiency in coding.","If money were no object, then I would definitely stay in the city or the state of New York just to be in touch with my family and because I feel uncomfortable living in cities such as Boston and California that does not have a flawed but efficient train system like New York. I would definitely study computer science because it was always intriguing and mysterious to me. I mean how can I create a program with just a few lines of code? It was always so cool to think like that and to admire that sense of curiosity. Time is always the obstacle of the people for that us humans are awake and active for about 16 hours and then the 8 hours goes to sleep. I believe time is the number one that I will have because computer science takes a lot of dedication and ongoing critical thinking. Making programs is not easy because you really have to implement and expand your mind in many ways. ","One of the most memorable events that I had last summer was to go to England. After 9 years of not going, I did not see many of my cousins grow up as they live in England and i live in New York. When I went to England, I had a great time partly because I did not see my cousins for so long and most of my favorite family members live in England. I do have cousins in New York but they are my paternal cousins. They are more strict and disciplined whereas my cousins in England are also strict but they do know how to have a good time. They made me feel really happy and also a wedding there was on my birthday. Finally, one of my cousins there is majoring in computer science and she gave me tips on programming and sent me lessons. This event in my life really prompted me to continue my major in computer science. My favorite cousin in the world majoring in computer Science. I wanted to continue his legacy.","Throughout my life I have coded many programs in different languages such as javascript, python, and java. One program that I had to code was to create a minesweeper program. It was a challenge for me because it took hours and hours of debugging but ultimately I succeeded. My hard work has paid off completing the program and this inspired me to continue studying Java. It also served as a warning in majoring computer science because debugging will have to be a frequent thing when writing a program. It also disciplined me because the project helped me stay in focus for that the day I finally debugged the project, when I slept after completing the project, I kept having thoughts to make it better. The next day, I committed 6 hours to implement a GUI designed program just because of my commitment to perfection. When I recieved a 100 for the project, I realized that the GUI was worth it.","I prefer working as part of a team because in my belief, it leads to more organization and it leads to a more proficient and well developed finishing project. Working solo is tedious because nobody is there too help you and you have to use your time to handle every task in the project. Working as part of a team is more efficient because you can divide the project based on the person's strength in the task. For example, if my friends and I were to do a science project, then one of my friends would formulate the experiment, one of my friends would design the poster board, and I would write the calculations and the written work because that is my strength. I would not design the poster because I am not an artistic person.

I feel that in Japan being “different” is widely accepted and even encouraged. Furthermore Japanese culture appeals to me greatly. I also believe that I would thrive in this environment because being too “mainstream” or “normal” is a worst nightmare for me. In Japan, I would study Biotechnology in Japan because one of my dreams is to develop an internationally-traded company based on nanotechnology. Japan seems like the best place for this as they are leading the world in their technological advances. Some obstacles that might prevent me could be the distance from my family and friends, and also the language barrier. I would have to study the hardest language on Earth before I go there which may make schooling harder. Overall Japan seems like the best place for me both personally and educationally.","Last summer was very adventurous for me as I tried many new things. But the one thing stuck out above all, was my experience at the wrestling camp, “Beat The Streets.” This camp taught me many things such as nutrition, strenuous workouts, and how to handle conflict with oneself. At this camp I was considered “fresh meat” as I was a newbie to this camp. In addition, I was a rookie at wrestling, which made me a feasible target for veterans at this camp. Towards the ending of the camp they held a tournament which I participated in that had a fairly sticky outcome. During the wrestling match I became very frustrated and showed a poor display of sportsmanship after I lost. Afterwards I apologized to everyone that I affected and left that camp with a fire in my heart to get better and better each day and strive to be the best. This was important to me because i was able to redirect this fire to other components of my educational life. In total, since that summer my study habits and drive for greatness has increased greatly.
",A fairly recent situation has affected me in many ways outside of my educational life. This year I had the amazing opportunity to take a college course known as AP World History. This course was challenging but it was challenge that encouraged me to do better. On standardized test i receive extra time as i struggle with finishing tests. Unfortunately about 2 months into the school year i was notified that my accommodations would not apply to this college course for various reasons. At first I was very discouraged and even considered dropping the class but starting something and not finishing it is very distasteful to me. In conclusion the next test i received I was determined to finish it and found a new system to do so.

One of those reasonings being, as we develop globally, the need to use and understand technology is more prevalent. Having not just an understanding but work experience really allow me to be a productive member of our society. Joining this summer workshop means a lot to me because I'd never being afforded an opportunity like so. Now that I am of age and I am eager to further my knowledge of computer science programming, I took a huge interest in applying. ","1. College has always been a momentous step for a vast majority of people. Taking a barrier such as money out of the equation, people are afforded to attend any University as long as their grades coordinate with the university standard. Given such option with my current GPA, I would be forced to attend Michigan Institute of Technology. There I would want to study Computer Science and Engineering. The reason I would want to major in such area is because I want to obtain the skills necessary for living in a fast pace revolving world. The obstacles that might prevent me from attending such university is not really having rd support from my family and friends that I would like. I feel that it's an important aspect of my life to gain support from them to keep me going. At the end of the day I know that I am doing it to better my life by I would someday want to own several companies whom which I would be the employer of multiple employees. ","2. In the summer of 16' I was fortunate enough to have a summer job through the placement of my high school. I had been working as a administrator and helping to manage my team in the daily work. The reason I picked this to be so important was because I had more than one job but one main task was to manage my team effectively. My aspirations in life are to be happy, own several companies, and be an entertainer. Owning several companies comes with a lot of strategic management and that's what I was gaining through the summer. I had come up with methods for me and my team as a whole to succeed and produce effective and efficient work flow. ","3. Throughout my life there had been many adversities that I've faced. When facing obstacles, I've learned to combat them with design thinking. Using quantitative thinking allows me to see beyond the problem but to find multiple solutions. A problem I had been faced with was creating my own music. As a personal problem, I try to devote as much time possible to that I could find a solution. What was so challenging was that I didn't have music editing software skills nor any knowledge about recording. The route I had taken was watch tons of YouTube videos and reaching out to friend who I knew had knowledge that I didn't. ","4. When it comes to large scale complicated things, I prefer to work in a team. The reason for a team is because I like to hold each other accountable so that the process might be faster than solo. In a group, there are more brains at work and it's less likely for there to be a problem oppose to solo where you tend to over look things. I value a team because a team can create something a solo cannot and that rapid productivity and mass creative thinking.

Not only is Temple University reasonably affordable it has a beautiful campus where I can see myself feeling comfortable in its environments. Adding to its attractiveness is the fact that Temple College of Sciences offers one of the majors I am interested in pursuing, computer science. Majoring in computer science has been an aspiration of mine for while because not only is it exciting to understand the machines that have enabled humans to achieve so much but the field of technology is for ever expanding and its very clearly evident in everyday life. If I attain a career dealing with technology, I can be a part of a “movement” that can make life for humans easier and more communicable. Most importantly, Temple is extremely convenient to NYC, which means it is close to my family and friends. Personally, I am very found of good relationships and a strong sense of community such as family who were responsible for shaping me into who I am today and instilling in me great life roots. (My parents also cook really well). Thus, with all it has to offer to me, Temple University seems like a great college choice if I were given the opportunity to select without any monetary concerns.
","Over the past summer, I had the opportunity to train six days a week in preparation for my sophomore cross-country season. Picking running as an important summer moment might seem peculiar but over the course of my ninth grade year running has shifted from a fitness and social aspect of my life to becoming one of biggest passions. 
At the beginning of my ninth grade, I had spontaneously decided to join my school’s cross-country team because a few of my friends were on it but it was to my dismay that I was not very good at it. Not only was I the worst on the team but also I seriously contemplating quitting the team after the first three practices. However, with a combination of the great team community, great coaches and the act of racing I decided to toughen the season out.

 Fast forward to the end of my freshman year (and the completion of three seasons: cross-country, indoor track and outdoor track) anyone could see that I lived and breathed running. Not only was the quest for faster event times intoxicating but the realization that running for the first time I felt a strong compelling to something in my life other than achieving well academically. 

With the conclusion of my outdoor track season came the disappointment of missing out on the state mile qualifying time by thirty seconds. Once again I started to contemplate about quitting as seemed I was the only freshman that did not qualify for states. Seeming me discouraged, my coach reminded me that I started the beginning of cross country with mile time of (18:48) and finished my outdoor season with a mile time of (5:46). It was there and then that I set my summer goal to train in preparation for the next year of running.

Therefore, when my ninth grade year was done I immediately started to research how to improve my running form and my running in general. It was during the summer while I read multiple books and articles on the running that I discovered what it meant to be self-aware and my affinity for the human body. I had placed an emphasis on running form because I had previously injured both my knees causing me to miss several practices and nearly causing me to quit with the long recovery process. As for self-awareness, I made sure to simulate a cross-country race/practice, which meant no running with no entertainment, treadmills, etc. This meant that I only had nature and my thoughts to entertain me, which greatly improved my self-awareness.

	Not only did I change my running form but I also changed my lifestyle to produce an environment that would enable me to become a better runner. To start, I made the decision to eat healthy which was extremely difficulty after a childhood of junk food. Not only did I improve my diet but, I decided to improve the way I thought about running. Instead of focusing on my knee pain or how fast my teammates were, I started to focus on the fact that I was living a healthy life and that I can run more miles in day than I used to run in a week.  To support my new mindset, I started to become more productive when I was running which including reading books on running culture and the human body and honing a few skills that I had never finessed including coding. 

	To summarize, running this past summer was important to me because it allowed to not only progress a runner but it gave me the opportunity to improve my life in general. I am very pleased to say that I was successful in my endeavors and my current lifestyle is benefiting from my summer of running.
","The year 2012 will always be memorable to me because it was the year I transitioned from a small campus and class size, African American dominated school to one of NYC’s leading independent school. My life before hand had not prepared me socially for a school that so diverse to what I was accustomed to that I did not know how to act. Growing up in all black neighborhood, an all black school and all black church did not and could never prepare me for the cultural shock I got seeing my grade and my school be dominated by white colored people. Although my parents were not racists, I simply was not exposed/interacted with white people on an everyday basis. Throughout my sixth grade year, I was so unsure of how to act or talk to my classmates and being the only black male in my grad made it extremely hard to share my thoughts with. I had an extremely hard time making friends or just conversing in general because I was overwhelmed by the sheer contrast of my home life versus my school life. My parents are extremely hard workers who have sacrificed so much for my brother and I and yet I felt embarrassed because it seemed that all of my classmates had two country houses and went on a vacation every school break. I was even embarrased about myself because my hair was so ""foreign"" to my classmates that they would always stare at it or just touch it. It was halfway through the year that I decided that since I could not converse with my classmates about their topics/culture then I could learn more about their culture while sharing some of mine. I started by throwing myself into various clubs and sports teams even though I had little interests in them before. I am extremely thankful for sixth grade me for having doing this because my “horizon” was immediately broaden and it there in those clubs and teams that I was able to forget about race and socio-economic status and just be a sixth-grader. Eventually, my classmates stopped touching my hair (with many protests and speeches about the importance of self-space) and stopped viewing as the new kid and started to view me as a member of the community. In a way by attempting to assimilate to my classmates culture to fit in, I instead grew more confident in my own culture because I realized I was unique and that I was just as a cultural awakening to many of my classmates as they were to me. Now currently in my fifth year at Packer, I am proud to say that I have made several friends and I am very comfortable in both my home and school life .","I personally prefer working with a team even though group projects seem to be the kryptonite of most people. Even though I fear the unbalance of work, I believe the pros outweigh the possible cons. The biggest pro I would have to say for group work is being able to share multiple train of thoughts/opinions because every person views a problem/question differently and by combining these different possible solutions you can view multiple options and contemplate which ones are the best. Another pro is that if some of my group members are people I normally wouldn’t spend time with, then I have an opportunity to converse with. The last pro of a group project is that you can hone important life skills such as collaborative thinking group-social skills and conflict-resolving skills. Also I believe that if there’s proper communication in group projects then you can resolve any concern or the unbalance share of work.",2/25/2017 11:12pm,3/20/2017 11:59pm,Yes,,2,2,2,905+133+108,Amazing Candidate.

An obstacle that might prevent this dream is that I might not be as passionate about math as I am now. Math has gotten increasingly difficult throughout high school and I know it is only going to get harder. So when I get old enough to apply to college I don’t know if I will be willing to pursue mathematics as a career. ,"Last summer I went with my family to visit my grandparents in Trinidad. This trip was a great experience because I got to meet with aunts, uncles, and cousins that I hadn’t seen in a long time and experience the great weather and beaches in Trinidad. This trip was important to me because I was able to see and talk to my grandmother. She passed away about two months after my trip and I am thankful that this trip allowed me to see her.","One time I really struggled with a school assignment was when I had to write a personal speech for my English class. This assignment was extremely challenging because it combined two aspects of writing that I consider myself to be very bad at, personal writing, and public speaking. The assignment was that I had to share a personal story with a moral in front of the class. I usually struggle to come up with personal stories to write about so I asked my parents to help me with selecting important moments in my life. For the public speaking aspect, I practiced in front of a mirror and my family for 30 minutes a day the 3 days before my presentation. I also asked some of my friends to proofread my speech for me. This assured that I was well prepared and my speech was refined.","I prefer to work in a team because in a good team you have people you can rely on to do their part of the project and for assistance if you need it. While working in a team does have its downsides if you end up with team members who don’t want to do their assigned part of the project, overall I enjoy working with other people on one collaborative goal. Whenever I need help I know I have people I can ask and I also know that I’m working with other people who care as much about the project as I do and will work hard to achieve a good result. In my experience, group projects are more enjoyable and operate more smoothly than solo projects. If you hit a block or an issue in a solo project it can be extremely difficult to get around this block but with group projects you can easily solve the issue and continue.

I know it seems far fetched but I love learning about these subjects and learning from such a prestigious school would be amazing not only because of rank but also the opportunities that will surely follow will be worth it.

Which I was too young for and my mother thought it wouldn't be safe. Thankfully, I got a job by helping my grandmother clean and cook as a housemaid.

For one time I got paired with a group of students I hated. I didn't hate them for who they are of course, I don't like to judge, but I hated them for what they did in class, nothing.

Computers are the reason why I am able to, even right now, complete this application. However, the first computer ever invented didn't include Microsoft Word or Spotify. It was a black screen with green letters. After years, people have worker together to create programs. Moreover, I want to learn how to create programs like early computer scientists. Learning to code can not only benefit me with computer programming but also thinking logically. All Star Code Summer Intensive is a great program for students like me because not much coding is offered for minorities, so this Summer Program is a game changer!","Even if money were no object, I would still go to NYU Tandon for Computer Science.  Reason being, I've always loved computers and the programming behind computers still is unclear. I want to clear that up. I love how in CS, logic is used often. Even for the mouse question for this application, I had to really think and choose the right answer. In a way, I liked how it was fun and interactive. NYU's CS program has many resources which can help me when applying to jobs. The only problem I see from achieving that dream is money. Growing up in a low income household with two other siblings, there is only so much my father could put in for my education. ","Sophomore year to junior year summer, I had interned at a place called Taxi Land.  The entire summer I truly understood the hard work and dedication you had to put in, in the real world. At first, I was told to stand outside the TLC office and give out fliers about TaxiLands's insurance in the sweltering heat. After 2 weeks, my boss saw that many of the clients came in with the flier that had my name on it. He realized I was doing the best out of my other 4 co workers outside. So he pulled me in and told me I was getting promoted to work in the office. Though I wasn't standing, the work was no less. I had to call clients after clients which I had learned from my fathers internship, and I told them about missing payments for their insurance. I dealt with large sums of money daily. Eventually I assisted in creating contracts with large networks such as Uber and Lyft.","Freshman year of high school, the first few weeks in, I broke my ankle. The injury led me to not be able to attend school for 2 months. Once I returned back some time before the end of Semester 1, I fell behind in school work such as Physics. Physics alone is complicated but without any guidance compared to other students, it was even harder. But that didn't stop me.So the next few months, I caught up with all missing work such as homework and labs for all subjects including Physics. I self taught myself the foundation of Physics which seemed impossible at first. At the end, I was awarded a ""Most Improved"" in Regents Physics. From this experience, I learned how to truly work hard and not stop. Because my freshman year wasn't the greatest year, my GPA was not the highest. And so, sophomore and junior I worked hard to make up the low grade.","I've always enjoyed working as a part of the team. Yes, I can always work solo.

I want to study BmE because its one of those topics where solving problems is the main priority and I love problem solving, I like the different ways you can solve a problem and the obstacles that you must overcome. Speaking of obstacles, an obstacle that can be anticipated that will thwart my ability to go to Johns Hopkins University would be other students. It wouldn’t be the other students grades but their extracurriculars and the outside school lives they have that make them look good. That’s why I want to join All Star Code, to give myself the chance to compete against the other students that apply to Johns Hopkins.","Last summer, I went to South Dakota alone for a program in Biological/Chemical Engineering at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. Days were a mixture of lectures and labs. At the beginning of days we would learn about some chemical process mid way through the day we would experiment. For example, in class we learned about the different Fermentation Plants around the US and we looked closer at the applications of Ethanol other than it being a bio fuel, we also learned the reaction process of Ethanol and when we got to the lab we made ethanol. Another example, we examined the chemical process of making chocolate and I created White chocolate, not as good as Hershey but edible. This trip meant a lot to me because it was the first time I went on a plane alone and the feeling that parents trust you at the age 15 is great, I actually turned 16 over this trip, July 20th.","Struggling constantly occurs in my life, but its not something that stops my desire to learn. A time interval in my life where I struggled was 7th grade to 10th grade. It started in 7th grade where they decide to put kids either in regents classes or regular classes and I was put into regular classes which wasn’t surprising because I wasn’t the brightest kid. I really was a slow learner and but gradually, I obtained better habits both in school and out of school. I began to take school seriously, it wasn’t easy but finally in 11th grade I am in the top 3 of my class with a 3.8 GPA for the first semester.","Working is something that requires focus and to focus I prefer working solo unless the team I’m working with can relate to me on the same intellectual level because if I work with a team that doesn’t understand me it becomes awkward and therefore I start to worry about the social aspect too much and it distracts me from the assignment or project which is what happened all throughout middle school and 2 years of high school but it was where I couldn’t relate to the same intellectual level of my group mates even though I wasn’t in the ‘smart’ class.

First and foremost, I want to attend college that resides in New York that is close to my family. Secondly, I want to attend a good college for engineering and applied sciences and I believe that Columbia is a great school for these subjects. Therefore, I can pursue my dream in computer science and engineering at Columbia University. However, the only obstacle that would prevent me from achieving this dream at the college is competition. Columbia University is a great school and many desire to attend the university. I believe that this is my obstacle because although I have above average grades, there is always someone who can do better than me. However, if I put my effort into it, I believe that I can leap over this obstacle and have a chance of attending this University. ","Last summer, together with people from Chess in the Schools, we collaborated with Trees NY to clean up the areas around parts of the trees. Additionally, I also enjoyed cultivating, mulching, and watering trees. This project or activity was important to me because I felt that a part my guilt that I carried in my life was lifted. From this experience, I felt good deep down because I did something for the environment for once when they have given us so much more. ","Struggles are a part people's daily life. For me, the greatest struggle that I had ever faced was during the early years of my school life. In my first year of school, I attended school late because I had just immigrated to the United States. Back then, I had no knowledge of the  english language. As hard as it may not seem, learning a second language then was an obstacle that I had to overcome. Since I was a slow learner, I could only comprehend a bit of english by the time I started first grade. Being unable to speak proper english in school gave a a sense of isolation because I had no friends other than the few people who were of the same ethnicity. Additionally, I had failing grades in my english subject. About every test I took that year was a  below passing grade. However, my teacher didn't give up on me and I didn't give up on myself. During my free time, I would go to my teacher and she would tutor me and give me encouragements. Using these encouragements, I studied hard every night until I had a passing grades on all of my tests. ","Working solo has it many benefits that include focus on the work that is in front of me and peace and quiet and quiet that allows me to work. As much as I like to work solo, I would prefer to work as a team. In a team, you get these ideas that would develop off your teammates. Different perspectives and ideas would happen during conversations. At the end, if the team compromise in some of the ideas and add them their own, you would get a better and more complex idea that you originally had. Furthermore, as a team, work would get done much faster compared to working alone. If there are any problems in the working process, you can ask your teammates to help you and correct any mistakes. Additionally, I believe that working as a team creates a different  experience for me. I may learn something that I may not know from my team members and I maybe by some chance teach my teammates something they don't already know.

I want to be become a major in computer science and be able to learn more about the ever changing technological world and become part of the minds that will be able to thrust our society into a new world full of innovations. The obstacles that may prevent me from achieving the dream is my access to the college. My family does not own a car and as a result commute would be difficult if I were unable to dorm there. Another obstacle that may come up is being able to balance all the school work and extra curricular activities. Time management is always essential to success. I am currently enrolled in AP and college level classes and have been able to manage my time and keep my average high. The transition to the new atmosphere and workload that college will bring may be an obstacle; however, I will be able to overcome it. ","Over the course of last summer, I had the opportunity to visit Ecuador on a trip to see family. This trip was especially important to me as I had not visited my mother’s native country since I was little and she herself had not gone back to for 30 years. Aside from being an emotional reunion, this trip was important to me as I was able to get back to my roots. Here in the United States you grow accustomed to everything always being available to you and in Azogues, Ecuador things are harder to find. I learned about the types of work people did such as carpentry, farming, cab driving, restaurants, and other things. The thing that struck me the most was the money these people made. In Azogues, people worked hard and I say this as because even my grandparents who were getting on their years continued working. It made me realize that my family were really noble and providing for your family is a very important element for us. At the same time I was also able to visit the city of Guayaquil where things were more modern and advanced. When I had gone when I was little, I did not remember technology being implemented a lot into their society. It seemed as it was only available to those who could afford it and was not necessary. Now as I visited my grandparents, although they live in the countryside, they had wifi that enabled them to talk to family members who were now in the U.S.A.. Over the past decade there has definitely been a technological advancement and I see it changing it for the better and that's what I aim to do as well. By this I mean using technology to allow for better living and communication.","I recall struggling with a school assignment where the requirement was to compose a google site that revolved around yourself. This occurred during my 6th grade year and was difficult for me as I had never created a site and did not know where to start. At this time as well I did not own a computer at home and was always struggling to do homework that required an internet connection and a computer. As a result I went to my public library and it was during the hours of homework help where volunteers would help children with their homework. I asked one of the volunteers if they could assist me with my project that involved google sites. Someone was able to assist me and they taught me all about the different applications google has and how I could use a template, insert photos, change the font, add subpages, and overall helped me better understand what the application did. I remember this moment as it taught me how there is always something new to learn about technology and how vast its uses were. As the years goes by, technology evolves and new programs and applications develop that allows people to become more connected with each other.","I enjoy both for various reasons. In my younger years I enjoyed working solo as I felt comfortable with myself and figured that I would not be an asset to a team. After joining my current school, The Scholars’ Academy, the emphasis on group work and group discussions allowed me to see the benefits of being part of a team. Being able to work as a team allows for the use of different minds with different ideas coming together to accomplish something. Something that you would have never thought of could be highlighted by one of your peers and that was something I saw as valuable. I enjoy working as part of a team now because although I do not know everything, every member has their strengths and working as a team allows for those abilities to shine. Working as a team is more efficient as alone you would not be able to accomplish something as fast as a team would. Teams are important in modern society because having many of the world’s brightest minds working together can promote new ideas to be further developed by members of the team, and could lead to new discoveries or achievements. At the same time working solo also has its benefits when it comes to assignments that require you to reflect on and not have too many ideas being thrown in at once.

I would like to study Computer and Mechanical Engineering. The main reason being that by nature I have a natural inclination to technology. I am a tactile and kinesthetic learner hence I am often drawn to the inner working of things by using my hands.  I have always been interested in how things work and what makes them work, especially with technology. All this being said within the STEM field I will be able to explore and develop my interests to better prepare for my future profession. ","Last summer I spent time with a family friend and was exposed to the  Information and Technology world. While with him I traveled to his different work sites and ran wire, set up a phone system and diagnosed internet connectivity problems. This experience helped pointed me in the direction for my passion and interests that I have today for the Computer and Mechanical Engineering fields. ","Last school year I was removed from school and placed on medical leave. I had recently received a concussion. I also had a deviated septum that lead to a series of sinus infections, one of which traveled to my brain. After several rounds of antibiotics, severe headaches, and an excessive amount of time lost from school I had surgery. I had to have surgery to repair my septum and remove my adenoids. My recovery time  required me to be at home for months. After this series of events, I am repeating my junior year. It was challenging to embrace the fact that I had to do that. I am very happy with that decision as I am healthy now and have had the opportunity to explore things like All Star Code.",When working on a task the majority of the time I prefer to work with a group.

Coding is becoming very important in today's society as technology grows rapidly opening up more job opportunities for those who want to study coding. I can see myself doing something in the near future related to coding and I personally feel like All Star Code can help jump-start it. ,"If money were no object, I would attend Carnegie Mellon University because it has one of the top computer science program in the United States. Not only does it have a top computer science program, but it is also very close to my home and I could make frequent visits to my family. The only obstacle that could possibly prevent me from achieving my dream is probably the school shutting down because when I put my mind to something, I won’t stop going after it until I achieve it. However, if there were actually an “obstacle,” there is always a way to get around it and achieve my dream. ","Last summer I was a teen mentor for a non-profit organization called the Boys club of New York. As a teen mentor, I joined a program in this organization called “Summer Superheroes,” where high school students help improve the literacy abilities of children from grades 1-4. As a mentor, I had to incorporate the idea of superheroes in order to make reading and writing enjoyable for a student who had a lower level literacy skill compared to other students in his classroom. This was very important to me because I felt like I made a difference in a student who was struggling in class when it came to reading and writing. I mentored two students, one whose reading level was four levels lower than the average third grader and the other who was two levels lower than the average fourth grader. After seeing both of my mentees in November, the fourth grader told me he improved three levels while the third grader said he is now among the required reading level for his grade. I felt very satisfied with the impact I had on these students because they did not go through a summer slump where most students drop reading levels instead of staying the same or  going to a higher reading level. Basically, making a difference in someone else's life made this summer internship very special and important to me.","There were a few times where I struggled with something. The most recent struggle was in my chemistry class. I felt like the teacher was not teaching a couple of the topics the correct way for me to learn and the class was very fast paced. I tend to learn best by actually doing chemistry problems or any type of subject related problems as well as working in groups to figure questions out. However, this class was mostly the teacher lecturing the students about a certain topic. I am going to be completely honest. The first chemistry exam I took for that class, I failed. Although tests don’t define intelligence, failure is not something I enjoy. Every day after I got my exam back, I went to my teacher during her free periods and spent countless of hours going over topics we were currently learning and ones we were going to learn later on in that school year. Even after understanding a topic, I made sure to ask my teacher for practice problems in order for me to get better at doing it. I am not a very good test taker but not giving up and forcing myself to accomplish getting better at chemistry helped improve my grade in that class and taught me a life skill of never giving up because if you work hard for something, it will come your way. ","I don’t necessarily mind working solo but I heavily prefer working as part of a team. To me, collaborative work is always the best way to get something right because there are multiple brains working together. Teamwork is very important in general because different people have different skills that can be used to accomplish a certain task while at the same time teaching the other members in your group what you know. While you teach someone else what you know, you can be gaining valuable knowledge from your peers because they would know something you don't.

The main reason I would go there would be to study with other likeminded people because I think it would really make me grow as a person.  The experience I would get from working with students on academic and possibly entrepreneurial projects would be awesome—who knows, we could become the next Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates. I can’t foresee any obstacles that would stop me from achieving that goal. I believe that I can achieve anything that I put my mind to—especially if I put in the hard work.","Last summer, my family moved to Huntsville, AL, which was somewhat exciting to me—that is until I received my grades from my Middlesex, my former high school.  Let’s just say, I became disappointed pretty quickly. After what I would consider a rough academic year at Middlesex, I was shockingly brought to the realization that my grade of a B- would force me to make a tough decision about whether or not to return to the school. Initially, the only thing I wanted to do was to go back to Middlesex so I began to diligently study math and AP Chemistry to prepare myself for another academically rigorous school year.  I also started playing sports more so that I could adequately prepare for my hectic tri-varsity sports schedule that included football, basketball, and track. My thought was that if I ended up with a B- again, I could at least try to get an athletic scholarship so that I could get into a good college to pursue computer science.  You see, I did not care how I got to college—all that mattered to me was going to a good school and majoring in computer science courses.  Sports was only a means to an end. 
However, all of that changed when I attended a technology science fair hosted by NASA.  While talking to a local family, I discovered a small, magnet school called New Century Technology High School, which quickly changed my perspective and gave me a new hope. It was right then and there, I decided to not change my dreams, but instead, change my strategy.  Why be forced to play sports in college—which could easily distract me from my academic goals, if I could gain a chance to go to college based on my academic performance in computer science. 
New Century Technology High School, while small and not nearly as prestigious as Middlesex, offered something that Middlesex could not offer me. Computer science! While I had initially gone to boarding school so that I could take computer science classes-my math grades kept me from matriculating into those classes.  In addition, my boarding school only offered two classes and no chances for participating in computer science related activities like hack-a-thons. So I followed my passion and decided to go to New Century Technology High School and I haven’t looked back.  I now have a 4.2 GPA with both, AP JAVA and C++ in the mix.  I joined an entry-level Cyber Patriots team of 9th graders and helped us reach make platinum level.  We did not make it to the nationals, but I was recognized by my teacher as a major contributor to the overall success of the team—Next year, I plan to be on a winning team. Lastly, I have launched my own educational coding organization called Wired In Computer Science where I will be teaching middle school kids basic coding concepts for game development.  My decision to change schools and pursue my passion changed my life and showed me that I am more than capable of achieving any goal that I set out to achieve, even if I have setbacks.","One of the biggest things that I have struggled with was a technology project I had at Middlesex. The project itself wasn’t particularly challenging. The IT person wanted the current school news to show up on an old TV outside the dining hall. However, this was very hard for a group of beginner programmers. With no leadership or real direction, the whole group splintered off into different people attempting to do different things.  We all had one goal in mind but no real steps to achieve that goal. While I was quieter and liked the fact that everyone was doing their own thing, I eventually decided to step up because the deadline for the project was coming up and we hadn’t had any visible progress. I got everyone together and organized us into groups. I tried to gain an understanding of what the group thought we needed to achieve our goal and then I asked each group to take a piece of the project so that we could make it happen. While we still didn’t get the project completed on time, I was proud that I learned how to take charge and lead a team. ","I prefer working as a team in terms of brainstorming and coming up with ideas. However, I think I prefer to  code and actually build software on my own. I like coding on my own mostly because I would rather be able to think and get in the zone and so far, I have only done this while coding alone and wired in.

I believe being apart of the All Star Code program will provide me the opportunity to expand my skill set and knowledge, by understanding the roots and process of coding. I look forward to building relationships with other scholars with the same mindset.","If money were no object, I would want to study abroad for college. I believe that I will not only have the opportunity to learn in a new environment, but I would be exposed to what the world has to provide. My time abroad would give me exposure to new cultures, languages and a number of life experiences. In addition to studying abroad, depending on the area I go to, I will be able to develop and improve my language skills as a second language by experiencing it front hand and not just in a classroom.Studying aboard is so important to me because it will expand my interests, allow me to meet new people and ultimately help me develop my future.

In regards to my major, I would want to study either marine biology or a path in engineering focusing on our shifting technology. I have always had a passion and excitement towards pursuing a career that improves marine life, solves global issues and utilizing my problem solving and creativity skills. I believe both areas of focus will allow me to tap into my strengths and explore things I am extremely passionate about. My time studying abroad in either fields, will provide me different perspectives on my studies that may not necessarily be provided in the U.S.

 If anything would prevent me from achieving that dream it would be myself, because if I work hard and do what I have to do, I can achieve  any dreams or goals I have set for myself.","Last February my grandmother who has been living with Alzheimer’s disease, for some time now was admitted to a rehab facility. Due to the factor that I am an ABC Wilton Scholar and do not reside in Teaneck with my family, I was unable to visit my grandparents as much as I would have liked. Over the course of the summer, I recognized my absence from family and friends and it became important for me to visit my grandmother. My grandmother's health had rapidly begun worsening and she was placed in hospice care over the summer. It’s difficult watching someone so close to you experience rapid changes to their health and being. However, every hour spent together made me so appreciative of the time we are given.  ","Last academic year, for my Western Civilization final exam I was responsible for preparing an argument on a Global Issue. I was challenged to figure out which ways we could spread global awareness and solve problems. Our global issue was the use of children soldiers. We were able to choose our partner, and I paired up with my friend. Since we were good friends and hanged out with each other, the in- class time we were given was not used properly because we got distracted. This did not  benefit our verbal and visual presentation. The final days approaching the due date, we were caught up with all the requirements of benchmarks like note-cards pictures and sources, however, we were behind on our presentation. I found myself doing the whole presentation by myself, and editing it. I was very hard for me because being apart of a CSP at Wilton ABC I could not work through the night, because of the set scheduled lights out. The workload was a lot to sort from our notes, that had to be  i adjusted to fit our slides and precisely how our teacher wanted it to be. I used every minute I had not occupied, to work on our presentation. I woke up early, and went to the school library during my free time. By doing so I was able to overcome this challenge and my partner and I had a creative and well designed final exam presentation. However, I ultimately learned that time- management is extremely important when doing projects. Picking a friend to work on an assignment may have not been the best decision, however the experience has thought me about responsibility and laying out a plan to follow going forward.","Personally I have no problem with either, working alone or on a team. Based on the task, assignment or work, I tend to choose to work individually. I'm able to manage myself at my own pace and ensure the completion of my task, use my own ideas and not be distracted. However, when working with a team, I am able to enjoy the experience of sharing ideas, equally cooperating and contributing to the group to get required task done. In different events and situations, working as a team can be beneficial and equally a fun experience.

I would study the effects of ocean acidification and global warming on marine life, and develop ways to reverse and prevent these effects. While the most of the people in the world are caught up worrying about politics, money, and fame, the world itself is dying. We are destroying whole ecosystems and causing entire species to become extinct - and yet our current president denies the impact humans have on climate change and refuses to acknowledge global warming. If our planet is going to thrive, we need to find innovative ways to save and protect our natural resources. I think it is important to earn a degree and work in a field that helps others and our environment, instead of one that only benefits you or the company you work for. Being a marine biologist might not be the most glamorous or exciting or profitable career, but it would be rewarding in its own way for me. It might be hard though because such a job is very demanding, I'd have to travel all over, and dedicate most of my time to research and field work, I wouldn't have me time, but I could deal with that, because I know that I'd be making a difference.","Last summer I was fortunate enough to travel across Laos for a month with my aunt. We stayed with local families in different cities and rural areas and spent our time exploring places and cultures I had never experienced before. We hiked through forests, swam in waterfalls, visited ancient Buddhist temples, ate delicious foods, and climbed through pitch-dark caves. Travelling to Laos was an enlightening trip. It made me really see what the rest of the world is like, and I came to realize that much of what we value in our society is not always what we should value. I was stunned by how different life is for people in Laos than it is for us in New York, and it gave me a new perspective. It made me start to question what we see as normal, and to want to focus more on helping the people around us in need in any way possible. Laos was incredibly beautiful. I can’t wait to go back there in the future. ","Trigonometry is challenging, it’s less math than conceptual understanding at this point, when we learned about radians I was baffled, and didn’t understand it in the slightest. While we moved on in class I was struggling to keep up with the increasing difficulty of radian problems. I decided I’d have to get some help, I talked to one of my friends who was having similar issues, and we went to the teacher together, and got help, now I can convert between radians and degrees easily, and have a better understanding of what they are.","There are some tasks that I prefer working on alone, but I have found the best work I have done has been as part of a team. Groups tend to produce better work more consistently, even though it is sometimes more difficult working with a team instead of working solo. When my team gets stuck I suggest we all take a break and go off independently to work. Then we come back together and tell about what we came up with, taking the best parts of each of our ideas and synthesizing them into something better than each individual one was on its own. When ideas are passed around in a group, you refine them into better ones; people point out things that you had not considered or noticed, or a team member might propose a simple solution that fixes a complex issue you couldn’t figure out. It is helpful to hear what someone else thinks or sees, and you can’t get that if you are always working solo. Thinking through something from different points of view pushes the group to be more creative and do better work.

Under the wing of experienced CTO Ross Levinsky, I had access to many of the questions and secrets of the hedge fund industry.  I was exposed to how securities are traded via algorithms and other ways investment firms allocate capital.  It is not everyday that an african-american teen is allowed into a hedge fund with no barriers and just curiosity.  I was not used to a work environment where everyone was passionate about what they do (at least not from my mother’s accounts of her job) and this experience was an eye opener; showing me that dreams do indeed come true for those who passionate and work hard for it.","Everyday throughout my apprenticeship at HBK I was challenged with keeping up with the information I was exposed.  What’s the point of doing an apprenticeship or internship and not leave more knowledgeable than when you entered?  I took it upon myself to learn how to code; I downloaded and read many pdfs about programming in python.  I can say with confidence that this experience not only exposed me to technology, but it forced me to develop a work ethic needed to succeed in higher education. ","I enjoy both working in a team and solo.  I prefer independent work, but often times I find teamwork rewarding.

I have also had exposure to computer science, which I think will benefit my academic prowess when I take it as a major at MIT. Some obstacles that might prevent me from achieving that dream would probably be finances. Tuition costs up to 49,000+ in US dollars, and this might not be achievable without the assistance of a scholarship to obtain. ","Last summer, I went on a cruise for the first time! My family and I sailed across the sea for 5 days, to reach Cozumel, Mexico, our destination. We got to witness the flora and fauna of the region, while also going on an excursion to see the Mayan ruins. This trip was important to me because I got to bond and spend more personal time with my family. During the school year, there wouldn’t be enough time to speak to my parents about my whole day. My brother and I are usually engulfed in the never-ending onslaught of homework given, so it consumes much of our personal life. However, after going on this cruise, it gave us an outlet to really connect with one another in a stronger way and to develop stronger relationships.","One time that I struggled with something was Physics, in school. The science of Physics and its topics and concepts always used to confuse me. This was displayed in several grades on tests and quizzes. There was also a period when I started to understand what was going on in the class, but that hope soon fell after we were introduced to more advanced topics covered in the basics. So, I took it upon myself to go to tutoring for extra help. Also, I decided to buy a regents review book for Physics, so that I could complete and attempt practice tests. The results helped me to target specific areas that I struggled with and to work on them a little bit more. ","I prefer working as part of a team. This is because you can receive different types of input from your teammates, which serves as feedback or improvements to what specific task is being addressed or performed. Once the final outcome is reached, it displays a combination of certain skills from each person in the group. In addition, it is important to know the value of teamwork.

It creates disbelief and deludes oneself from achieving their goals. I believe one can definitely become successful without money. Realistically, if money was not a problem and I could choose any college,  I would go to California Institute of Technology. Also, I would study MechanicalEngineering, because it has been a dream of mine since I was young. I always loved how machines and infrastructures worked. I would always be interested in creating tiny objects since I was a young child. Ever since middle school, I decided that I was going to be an engineer no matter what.From the knowledge I obtained in school, I try to implement my learnings on to practical experiences . If anything in the house ever broke down like: fans, air conditioners or even computers, I would be the first one to try and fix the issues. In addition, I believe obstacles aren’t problems, they’re just challenges for someone to resolve. I have confidence that if everyone focused and tried their hardest, they can defeat their obstacles or in better terms “challenges”. One of the many obstacles that can prevent me from achieving my dreams is the difficulty in assimilating to my surroundings. In other words, I’m from the East Coast and going all the way to West Coast will make me a little uncomfortable adjusting to the environment there. I will most likely stay away from family and friends and will have to do my best over there. However, other than that I believe I can achieve my dreams no matter the issue.
","The summer of 2016, I went on a trip to my home country, Bangladesh. My parents decided to take my sister and I to go see our home country after 7 years. I had a great and  exciting experience that made me think about life in a new way. Bangladesh is a third world country, located in the Indian subcontinent. Thirteen percent of the population  live below the national poverty line of an average of $2 per day. Streets are filled with beggars and unfortunate people. Seeing my family, and their lifestyle of living versus mine was also a sad thing for me. I had lived in the city (Dhaka) for one month, and one month in the village. Living in the village was really different from the city. No air conditioning in humid weather, the power would go out sometimes and I resided in a dangerous environment. I went on trips to different  regions: poor, middle class, and rich areas. The rich and middle classed people could only survive, where the poor would barely get to eat everyday.  This made me see how lucky we are in the United States that our lifestyles are so better than theirs. The homeless people in America get an enormous amount of benefits while back in my country they’re left to die. After this trip I have decided that I will change my motives and donate portions of my wealth to help my parents country to become better economically. Therefore, I have to work hard to become a successful person. ","One of the many times I struggled with something was when I was trying to finish my Rocket Project for my College Physics class. I was having such a hard time figuring out the concepts and which formulas to use, that I was stressed because it was a 50 point project. I had to calculate how long it would take a rocket to get to Mars in meters/seconds. I called my friend who is studying Mechanical Engineering in New York University, and asked him for help. He taught me the equation formulas and the concepts on how to solve it. Then, have I finally finished and received a 100 on my project.

I would probably try to apply to the NYU: Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music. I am really interested in the Musical arts, but since being an artist is high risk and hard to support yourself long-term; I have decided to make writing music my hobby. I will continue to make music for fun and if I get a following that will be great. Right now I am focused on Engineering, Computer Science, Business. I find all of these majors very interesting.

I haven’t programmed since and really would like to get back into it. With my focus shifted to towards more STEM majors, I would love to go to Michigan University, Caltech, and Cornell.

However, most programs were costly and or didn't meet the expectations I was hoping. After meeting the ASC representative in my school, I was surprised I had never heard of the programme, and that it met all the expectations I was hoping for.","Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is where I'll attend if money weren't a factor to my education. MIT has always being my dream school far before I even got introduced to the field of technology and computer science. MIT accepts only 18% of its globally positioned applicants, creating a unique, rigorous, and diverse learning environment. It would be a dream come true if I may ever get the opportunity to study in MIT.","Last summer, at the beginning, I was really discouraged because I hadn't gotten an internship at Morgan Stanley, which I had planned my entire year in preparation for. However, after a few TED talks on motivation and confidence, I realised that I had aquired skill in programming and other CTE skills I could apply in different situations. I dressed up my resume to include all my accomplishments and past internships. I set out into the city on my skateboard and went to the local new restaurants, asking if they wanted a website to improve their businesses. People were skeptical until I showed them my resume, and asked them to give me a chance. They even allowed me to set the price for the job, and promised a raise for a job well done beyond their expectations. I concluded the summer break with self-earned money in my pocket, and more impressive things on my resume. I built websites for 3 business owners that summer.","Before high school, at the end of primary school, unlike my siblings, I did not read books and the huge novels they read; the conventional read a novel types. My mother of course wasn't pleased with me because I never picked up a book of the family shelves to read. However, I read articles more than 10 a day. I was educated on the status of politics in the country and over seas. I couldn't recite the lines in hunger games novels like my sister did, but I could educate my mother on the status of the Isralie-Palistanian conflict. My mother assumed I wasn't getting the education I should because she never saw me reading books. This was challenging because I sometimes felt inadequate for I did not meet my parent's expectations, however, I explained to them I was skilled in different things, and was interested in different fields of study."," I have always worked solo, and very few times worked with a team. Instances in which I worked with a team were during hackathons around the city and at school.

Being an avid video game lover is what led to my interest in coding. I've always wanted know how the characters move so life-like and how the button inputs create movements in the game, it truly fascinates me. Having done research on some video game development companies such as High Voltage Software and Valve Software, I noticed there was a lack of diversity on their development teams. Another reason I wanted to become immersed in coding, since there is evidently not a lot of people in the industry that are of color and I really want to change that stigma. Through this amazing program, I think that I'll actually have the opportunity to do it.","If money were no object, I would love to attend Stanford University and study Computer Science. I remember when I visited Stanford, last year in February, and the atmosphere was awe-inspiring. There were hundreds of students buzzing around campus trying to get to their classes and the tour guide was telling my family and I how this university has produced notable alumni such as the co-founder of Google Sergey Brin, and the creator of Snapchat, Evan Spiegal. I truly want to become immersed in this atmosphere of computer minds and become successful in the industry because I feel coding brings people's dreams into reality. I believe the only obstacle that could prevent me from achieving my dream is myself, honestly. I really need to push myself academically and continue to practice coding and other computer development to accomplish my dream of having a serious career in computer science. ","Last summer some friends from my previous school, Frederick Douglass Academy 1, and I volunteered at the 2015 Special Olympics in Queens. There, we helped the participants to their stations and entertained them while they were waiting for various competitions. We also distributed water and cheered them on during their contests. This was extremely important to me because it exposed me to people who were mentally and physically disabled. I've never really spent intimate time with mentally/physically disabled people so this experience will always stick with me. Actually talking to them showed me what they go through daily and how strong they were to actually compete in the Olympics despite their disabilities. I will always admire them because they have to wake up everyday to people looking at them as if they are inferior and they always prove those people wrong.","In the ninth grade, I had moved back to NYC from Detroit and had to swiftly catch up on algebraic curriculum in time for the Regents Exams yet, for some reason, Algebra I was extremely difficult for me. Quadratic functions always puzzled me because there were so many steps to remember and the questions always didn't follow the same format. Whenever I thought I understood the material it would just stop making sense again. This perpetual cycle of confusion almost caused me to give up. But, fortunately, I didn't. I decided to stay everyday after school for tutoring and even went to tutoring during lunch. Eventually I got a good enough grasp on the material to pass the Algebra I Regents with an 81. Not what I wanted, but I was still glad I got above an 80 when I only had 3.5 months to learn the material.","I prefer to work as a part of a team because multiple ideas and opinions synthesizing to create an amazing product is the best.

It must of been a life changing experience since in that moment he knew what he wanted to do.  I hope to be like that and find a passion for coding and computer science. I need some motivator like ASC to help me decide if this is what I want to do for the rest of my life.  ASC can help me guide towards that path that I need and also to connect with other who share the same passion.  ASC can also help me learn new code language which will greatly benefit me since I'm planning to join my school's robotics team. I want to be a leader in the robotics team so the ASC SI can make me gain confidence for it. ,"If money were no object,  I would go to NYU, Wesleyan University, Stony Brook University ,  or Fordham University. I chose these schools because I have visited them and were among the best options for me in regards to academics and location. I would study medicine and computer science since I'm in another program called Medachieve,  which helps East Harlem students explore the field of medicine and do hands on activities with med students. My mentor is a med student and she inspires me to pursue medicine as a career since not only do you benefit yourself,  you benefit the society. Some obstacles I would face is probably freshman year since I have to adjust to college level work and know what I really want to do in college. ","Last summer, I attended a summer program with EHTP. It was a 6 week program with classes Mondays through Thursdays. We had a book club,  coding,  and college preparation course as classes. In coding,  we made phone apps that worked and I made a whack a mole game. We also went to a 1 week college trip to Washington DC. We stayed at the GW campus and visited colleges like Georgetown and American University. This trip is important to me because not only did I have fun,  I gained awareness of colleges outside of New York and how these colleges provided great opportunity for students.",I once struggled in first marking period of English class in 10th grade. I struggled to keep up with the class as quizzes were given out daily and we had to do other assignments on top of that.  This was a class that foreshadowed a college class which is difficult. I overcame it by putting an hour each day to study the assignments we had and to improve on quizzes. It was my goal to get above a B+ and at the end of the year I did just that. ,"I prefer to be part of a team.

I want to be part of this cause and at the same time create a brighter future for myself. The All Star Code Summer Intensive program will help me fulfill this dream of mine to have a career in computer science and that is why I want to participate in this program.,"If money was not an object, I would apply to the best colleges. My dream is to go to MIT or NYU to study electrical engineering or robotics because I have been very interested in those fields since I first built my first robot. Just seeing the robot move was very fascinating to me and I decided to pursue these interests further. Some obstacles that might prevent me from reaching that dream is getting into those colleges. Both of these colleges are extremely hard to get into and the students that apply to them are very intelligent.This motivates me to keep working hard and show these colleges that I care about my future. This is why I want to do as much as I can on my free time to show these colleges that I am hard working.","Last summer was not very eventful for me. I didn’t really do much other than walk through the different areas of Manhattan to explore. However, one special moment that happened to me last summer was a family trip to Bear Mountain in upstate New York. This trip was very special for me because my entire family is very busy most of the time and in their free time they just like to sleep it in and relax. This leads to my family to not have time together and that one time in the summer that we spent a whole day together was very memorable. Although we did not do much that day, just being with my family and eating together made that the best day I’ve had in years.","I have always considered myself a fast learner, not necessarily smart but i learn quickly by observing and trying. However, Sophomore year was very difficult to me. Sophomore year was the year I took my first AP class and that made me realize what college work would be like. AP World History made me realize that the method of observing and trying to memorize information does not always work. The amount of work given in the class made me stress most days and impacted my grades in other classes as they started to decrease. At first I did not know what to do and my bad habits did not help either. Most of the time to deal with the stress and the amount of work given, I would seek help from close friends and they helped me relieve my stress. I also started working on my studying habits little by little and that helped me be better in my AP class and other classes. By doing this to help me overcome the challenge, I managed to get a three out of five in the AP exam which was a big improvement from the score of one that I got on the practice exam.","I have always been the type of person to work as part of a team.

If academic performance was magically not considered, I would study at M.I.T and study Computer Engineering. I would study Computer Engineering because I’ve always been interested in computers for my entire life. Also, I spend way too much time playing video games on the computer. If I could spend that so much time on my computer, I might as well be able to know how the internal components functioned. However, I can’t just go to any school and expect to be allowed in with open arms. In reality, the only two things that could hinder my dreams are my academics and my parents. Although I’m a good student with an average of 98, I may not be competitive enough to make it into a prestigious and well known university. Lastly, my parents wouldn’t let me do as I please in terms of higher education. My mother, in particular, would call most of the shots, thus being a possible catalyst to my dreams falling apart.","Last summer, I planned a mini-vacation to drop my brother off at the school he attends (SUNY Brockport). Although this trip could have been planned the day before, it was still the most interesting and funnest thing I did last timmer. For the trip, I purchased 3 train ticks (2 roundtrip) to Rochester, NY. Then, my mother would rent a car in Rochester to drive the 15 minutes to drop my brother off at the campus. In my opinion, this plan was absolutely perfect and would go off without a hitch. In my surprise, and in the surprise of my brother and mother, the plan went off without somebody getting lost in the maze that is Rochester. This trip was important because it involved my *perfect* planning skills and the loss of my brother for 4 months. First, I love to plan everything I do before I actually do it. For example, I always make an outline for my essays and my applications (including this application). Secondly, I would lose my brother for 4 months. Although my brother is slightly annoying at times, I feel weird not having him in the house. Even though we don’t play games with each other anymore, it still feels weird to not having a screaming 18 year old in the living room.

","I’ve struggled many times in my life, but not as much when I attended a college course at NYU. The college course was Literature as Exploration taught by Professor Packer. In this class, we learned how to explore the deep and underlying meanings of complex texts. In this class, we had to write two essays. The first essay was relatively easy, but the second essay was completely confusing. For the second essay, I had to write several pages on my morals and include text connections that correlated with my personal morals. Not once in my life had I been required to explain my morals. The difficult part of the essay was not what to write, but how to write it. I couldn’t ask anyone around me for help as I was the only expert on Earth who was knowledgeable enough to write an essay about my personality. To overcome my issue, I decided to write as much as I could in 3 pages in the form of an autobiography. Afterwards, I would make basic textual connections that represented morals. At the end of this struggle, my essay had earned me a grade of A-.","I prefer to work by myself, but it's for a reason one my not expect. When I am in a group, I always end up with people that aren’t very bright. I always end up doing the “hard part” and sometimes even more. Also, I usually end up with those who don’t know the basic fundamentals of a “group.” I always end up having to be the mender of the group, where there are those who don’t understand the topic at hand and attempt to do the assignment. Likewise, the middle school that I attended was absolutely terrible. In my middle school’s 12th grade, there were 12th graders who were still taking Algebra I (I took that regent in 8th grade).

In High School, I take Computer Repair and coding classes. The reason why is because ever since I was young, I was really interested in computers and coding and I wanted to do something like this for so long. It would be so cool to participate in this summer program. Also, I really like games that include coding, like Minecraft. I administrate many servers in Minecraft, and I operate them by adding plugins and fixing problems. I really enjoy coding, and the hour of code (which I took twice, in 9th and 10th grade) this program made coding even more fun. Also, my class took a trip to Google and I learned how to use Scratch. It was fun and I really want to continue growing in the technology field.","If money was not an obstacle, I would go out of state for college. I would study psychology, because I really like talking to people, and it feels good being able to help people with their problems. Since I am alone most of the time, the conversation is as beneficial and enjoyable to me as it is to the other person. My personality and habits can sometimes prevent me from achieving my dreams. For example, two of my negative personality traits are giving up too easily, as well as dealing with my emotions. I have great self-control, but there are times when I get very emotional about things. However, I do not express my emotions in anger, but usually in solitude. There are also bad influences surrounding me in school which try to bring me down. Despite all that, I am constantly working on becoming a better person. ","Last summer was very monotonous for me. I had to go to summer school, so I couldn’t attend the YMCA camp which I typically enjoy. But good thing is that I found a Minecraft server! Pundertale is a Minecraft server dedicated to the game “Undertale” by Toby Fox. I liked Undertale, so I started playing on the server. It is extremely fun, and I still play it regularly. When I first joined Pundertale, I was a member. Everyone on the server welcomed me, but I was so scared that I rarely spoke. At first, I didn’t understand the conversations that I saw in the general chat, but over time I understood them.  I was surprised that I actually liked the server a lot. As I began to log in frequently, I slowly started to come out of my shell by assisting other staff members and players with their needs in the game, (for example, completing a project or building.) At that time, the server really meant a lot so to me, so I donated money. Lately, I have been donating more to the server because I figured that it needed help; for example, fixing lag problems. Lag is when a game or server experiences slower speeds. Many people recognized me for donating, and they suggested that I should apply to be a staff member. I was reluctant at first, but I applied anyway because I was curious to see how it would feel to be a staff member on a public server. On September 23rd, 2016, I received the rank “Chat-Moderator.” I didn’t feel as if I deserved it, but I began to see why I did deserve it. At first, It was very hard but I got used to it, and it became easier to handle. In November, I got promoted to the rank Administrator, making my job a bit harder. Again, I got used to it. I got promoted again on February 22nd, 2017, to the rank Operator on the server! I was very shocked and happy; everyone congratulated me. Pundertale really means a lot to me, and I am pleased to see how the server has grown since I joined in July. I want to keep helping Pundertale in any way that I can, by donating or doing things that can benefit the server. If it wasn’t for my experiences on Pundertale, I think my life would have been so much different, and I wouldn’t have as many close and caring friends as I do today.","Recently, I had a math exam. Whenever I have exams, I panic and feel anxious. I’d be pessimistic about what I'd score and how hard the exam may be. However, the test was fairly easy and simple, except for the last question. I felt so defeated when I read the question and saw the graph. Discouraged, I wanted to give up completely. When my teacher noticed, she reassured me that I could do it. Thanks to her encouragement, I didn’t give up, and although it took me about 15 minutes to understand the problem, I managed to solve it. 
When I got the exam back, I was surprised at my score. It was not what I was expecting. The question that I struggled with was half correct. I felt very proud of myself. Even though it was only half correct, I was happy that I tried and didn’t give up.","Working alone is great! Though, it does have its disadvantages. As for me, I would rather be part of a team and not the leader. Being a leader is hard, because most of the responsibility falls on the leader. I like working as part of a team because everyone’s ideas can come together to make the project successful. For example, on Pundertale, there are nine staff members. The nine of us work together to help the server grow.  Working with other people is fun, and I enjoy being exposed to different ideas and viewpoints.

The first is that this college is highly regarded for its mathematics and science courses which I would enjoy learning about. I enjoy learning more complex math and sciences because they allow me to better understand the universe around me and can be applied to virtually anything, and I would like to use my gained knowledge to increase others understanding of the universe we live in and make it a better place to live in. Another reason this college is so fascinating to me is because the courses you can take are very diverse from the arts to political science, and though I probably won’t be good at the courses I would like to take them so that I can simply increase my knowledge and use everything that I have learned to possibly increase others’ knowledge and understanding, while also making the world we live in more peaceful, cleaner, and more accepting.","One thing that was very important to me was to help organize my friend birthday party, which occurred over the summer. My friends have a tradition of throwing makeshift birthday parties for other friends at this park near our school, more specifically near a tree in the park which has been doubted the Kapei tree; I would explain why it is called that but I don't want to go off into too long of a tangent. Anyway going back to the topic at hand, I felt bad because we had thrown numerous birthday parties for our friend at the park and my friend wouldn't get to have one because people tend to neglect summer birthdays. This made me take it upon myself to organize a make-shift party for my friend because it didn't feel right to me that she didn't receive one, also I had been friends with her for 8 years at the time and I never celebrated her birthday with her and really wanted to.  So using text message we organized a party that took place practically weeks after her actual party, and not that many people could make it, but four people were able to make it and it was still a fun party. ","One time where I really struggled for something was a school project where we had to make either a drawing or alternative ending to a book we read in our English class. Though I like writing much more than drawing I decided to take the art approach to the project. We were given two weeks to read the book but I ended up reading it in two days so I could get a head start on the project. We were supposed to make our interpretation of the tree the main character drew in the novel, and I started planning and practicing for the project. I knew I wasn’t going to have the best drawing because I am bad at art, and there are multiple people much better at art in my grade, especially these two girls that absolutely perfect at everything artistic. Knowing this I still worked hard on my drawing and even got pointers from one of the girls to better draw and sketch which I still use to this day. After multiple “why didn’t I take the alternative ending route” and staying up all night the day before it was due to make it perfect it was done and if anything I was proud to say I did it. When I showed my friends and my teacher they were all impressed and were equally impressed by the poem I added to the back of the drawing, though my project was still overlooked by the amazing artists, I am still proud of what I was able to achieve and equally proud to hang that drawing up in my room."," I work better in a group than I do solo. This is because when you are in a group you can equally distribute the work, stress, and reward, while also being able to confide in others if the work ever becomes too straining. In a group, you can have multiple people working on a project and either work on a project that is harder or works on a project faster than you are able to do alone. Working with others also allows you the ability to various abilities at your disposal because not everyone knows the same stuff. It is also much more fun working in a group because though you must all work hard the quality of work can greatly be enhanced in the environment people are working is a fun and entertaining one, and that is much easier to achieve working with other opposed to working alone.

As of now, I’m apart of my school’s debate team. I recently became the first ever student from Collegiate to qualify for Congressional Debate States which takes place in April. I participate in a style of debate called “Congress” which as the name suggests functions like the actual House of Representatives or the Senate. Students, otherwise known as representatives or senators, are tasked with giving speeches in affirmation or negation of whatever bills are picked for that tournament. These bills cover various topics, but are mostly centered around current social issues such as background checks, police equipped body cams, community college vouchers, abortion, drone strikes, and even the release of tax returns for all presidential candidates. Debate has given me the ability to rapidly analyze arguments and then formulate possible rebuttals to the different sides of these arguments. My confidence in public speaking has increased; my ability to improvise has increased; and most importantly, my ability to capture the audience’s attention using rhetorical devices, hand gestures, and comedic analogies has increased. Becoming a lawyer would allow me to hone these skills which would also be useful for an entrepreneur.","Last summer I participated in a Prep For Prep run program called IFE (Institute For Entrepreneurship). Over the course of the four week program, I worked with a Google mentor to create a potential startup business. By the end of the program, I was able to formulate the costs of running my actual business, I got an idea of what makes a startup business successful, and I learned how to market. I improved this same business idea and entered it into an international competition called the “diamond challenge” through the University of Delaware this past school year. Thrillingly, the idea made it to the semifinals which will be taking place this April. The summer program exposed me to entrepreneurship—something I plan on pursuing in the near future.","In 7th and 8th grade, with the assistance of three other classmates, I ran a club called ICUC (Inclusive Community for Uniting Collegiate). Our small group taught classes and led discussions throughout the middle school on topics that the school administration failed to discuss from stereotypes to race jokes to the definition of sexism to identity and other social issues at the time. Although our intent was clear, older students did not like the idea behind our initiative. They saw our group as a few students trying to gain the favoritism of certain teachers; students thought that we weren’t really interested in addressing the topics we discussed in various classroom settings. As a result, we researched different classroom activities and discussions that addressed the same issues. The activities that we led in individual classrooms became more fun and encouraged group participation rather than powerpoint presentations or lectures. By coming up with more interactive activities, we were able to improve our group’s image. In the end, we even collaborated with the Director of Student Diversity to host a school wide assembly.","I prefer working as part of a team.

","Last Summer, I ran hundreds and hundreds of miles. As a long distance XC/track athlete, I enjoy running for many reasons. Beyond recreational and health benefits, I think running has impacted me in many ways, and has taught me lessons throughout time. I enjoy the challenge of running, because there is no real finish line. There is always more to grow from, and the desire to go farther or faster. From running, I’ve become more disciplined, hardworking, patient, and perseverant. ","Although I am not a perfect student, I do very well academically in school. If there was one subject I’ve struggled with recently, it would be AP Statistics. Since it’s more analytical than logical, new concepts are harder to grasp, especially when there is new vocabulary to understand at a rapid pace. I think I’ve learned that it takes patience to completely understand everything, usually within few days. After being introduced the material, I typically ask my teacher questions, and watch how other people teach it on Youtube or Coursera. Over the next few (somewhat frustrating) days, I begin to understand the material before the test. It’s just a matter of time.","Working alone is great for focus, but it will never lead to great growth.

In addition, this program can give me insight into what to expect from entering the field of computer engineering.","From an early age, Computer Engineering had peaked my interest. I am interested in majoring in computer engineering in college. If I didn't have to worry about the cost of college, I would go to a college or university that has an engineering program that is universally recognized. Going to a college or university like this would help me become the best-equipped engineer that I can possibly be. In addition to computer engineering, I would study economics and physics, as understanding finances is important and physics has fascinated me ever since my first physics course. I may also explore other areas of study, like Robotic Engineering, Computer Programming and mathematics, because they are also appealing to me. Additionally, I may study a language, histories, and arts to be well-rounded. Obstacles that I would have to overcome in order to become a computer engineer are rigorous courses , my personal challenge with finishing tests, and shyness.","Last summer I was enrolled in a college english class at Medgar Evers College. This class was by far the activity most important to me last summer. I wanted to experience being in a college class and perform the best that I could. From an early age, English was the subject I struggled most with. So I believed that performing well in this class would be an indicator that I was on the way to having a successful college career. I put a great deal of time into the class (reading the materials covered in class, going over class notes, and checking out resources that the professor gave the class). I also worked to improve my writing because I sometimes struggle with it. At the end of the course, I received a B. This was not the grade that I wanted, however I believe that it was a great accomplishment, as I was a rising junior at the time. This experience was important to me and it showed that with effort I can overcome my weaknesses.","In junior high, I struggled with managing my time while taking exams. Completing an entire test in the time given has never been easy, often finding myself rushing to finish before time was up. Time management has been a common vocal point in Parent Teacher conferences, as many teachers found it hindering my performance in their classes. This was very embarrassing and frustrating for me, so I began to search the internet for ways to improve my time management. I found that getting proper sleep every night and eating a proper breakfast could increase my focus throughout the day. In addition, I found that studying regularly, in contrast to only studying before tests, would increase my familiarity with the subject material for my classes, and therefore decrease the amount of time needed to respond to questions. I also acquired some test taking strategies such as keeping track of time during a test and answering more difficult questions after answering easier ones. With these preparations and new strategies at my disposal, managing my time became less challenging. I no longer felt constrained by the amount of time I had, and was able to put more focus on the exam rather than wondering if time would run out. As a result, my performance in my classes improved. Since then, I have kept mindful of my time management and it has been less of a challenge for me. I have also learned to deal with any challenges head on. ","When working on something that I am familiar with, I usually prefer working on it by myself because I can work at my own pace. However, having access to others is always helpful. On lengthy projects, having others to work with is definitely better because the project can be completed faster. Additionally, if a project requires skills that I am lacking in, having a team to consult and work with would be preferable. When studying I usually do a mix of self-study and studying with friends. Studying with colleagues usually helps to correct me and reinforce my knowledge of subject material. On a large scale, I believe working in groups is profitable because the group can support and learn from each other. In the future, I will continue to work in groups because it will help me on my journey to success.

I have received an education that has made me aware of the excruciating forms of inequality that exist all over the world and I hope to contribute to the fight against these injustices. Nonetheless, if I had the choice to attend any University, I would choose Columbia University. Attending a school like Columbia University would not only allow me to easily interact with the community I grew up in, Harlem,  but it would also allow me to create connections with other students and alumni whom, in tandem with my efforts could assist in my coalition for change. I am incredibly interested in studying economics and computer science. I believe economics is an extremely important subject because an understanding of the global economy can help one greater comprehend the financial disparities and economic inequalities that exist throughout the world. The reality is that so many children in the world are dying from easily preventable diseases, suffering from hunger, and lacking an adequate education when there are more than enough resources to provide the basic necessities of life for everyone. I have come to understand that an increasingly connected world that is expanding through globalization and innovation in technology will be at the forefront of our near future. I hope to take part in the turn into a new age of technology by studying computer science. To pursue all of my aspirations in life I know how imperative my education is. Without a quality education, I would not be able capable of getting into a great college and moreover, I would not be able to properly equip myself with the tools I need to create the change I wish to see in the world. Therefore, acknowledging this obstacle, I hope that by taking part in the All-Star code program I can learn to program and cultivate new skills that will help me with my future goals.","Last summer, I had the great opportunity of taking part in many activities such as participating in a paid internship with the SYEP and taking a trip to the white house in Obama’s last months in office. However, what was most influential to me was my volunteer work at the Naomi Berry Diabetes Center. In this job, I got to work alongside, scientists, doctors, and social works to help take care of kids and show them that type 1 diabetes is a disease that does not restrict people from unleashing their full potential. This message is especially important to me as a few years back, I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. This was a difficult transition for me to cope with and as I continue to adjust to this new reality in my life, it felt really good to know that I could help other kids going through what I had already gone through and help make their transition at least a little bit easier. The joy that I had from volunteering was important to me because it showed me how great it feels to give back.","One notable time in which I struggled with something is a Humanities project that represented my final grade in that class. A close friend and I were tasked with creating a 10-minute documentary to accurately depict the issues regarding segregation in the south during the 1960’s. In less than a month, we had the responsibility of securing a loan for a video camera worth over $4,000, conducting background research on Supreme Court cases, and political tensions that lead to the segregation in the south. We were also tasked with casting and reaching out to lawyers, professors, authors, judges and political activists to take part in the film, as well as directing and editing all of the film as well. With limited time, this proved to be a very difficult task and we struggled to complete it. However, during the times it seemed most impossible, it helped to focus on the end goal because reminding yourself of what you are striving for always serves as a strong form of motivation. Along with working as hard as I can and communicating well with my other group member, the project ended up looking incredible and we were very satisfied with the grade we received. ","I feel that this question generally depends on the type of work that I am hoping to complete. There are always benefits to working alone, such as a lack of dependence on other people which means I can hold myself accountable for everything and I do not have wait on other people. When you work alone, you can work on your own schedule with no disputes or misunderstandings with other group members. Nonetheless, I would say I generally prefer working as a part of a team. Working in a group allows for diversity of thought. When you work with other people, you get to hear new ideas. Working in a team maximizes creativity and imagination and this can always positively affect the group’s goal. Atop this, the concept of a team, in which people are brought together, aspiring towards a common goal holds something special. A team that is tied together through a common goal is more likely to achieve this goal and therefore working in a team incentivizes togetherness which is always helpful in motivating and inspiring me to work.

","It has been a dream of mine since I was little to one day attend NYU. As I get closer to my senior year and application time, I’ve begun to gather information as to what I wanna major in as well as opportunities NYU would give me. The Stern School of Business is a business school in NYU, and one of the top business schools in the country. However, tuition is one of the main concerns I have before applying. If money were no object, NYU would be my ideal university to attend and I would study business management & administration. One day I hope to become a CEO, or maybe even a business consultant. In order to successfully become one though, I must master the skills required such as the basics of business and how they work. Attending NYU would also allow me to further develop my leadership and networking skills. Personally, an obstacle that would stop me from attending NYU are the limitless possibilities there are for me. I would always wonder if NYU is really the school or me, and I often ask whether or not another university would give me a better chance at gaining the experience needed to build a strong career in the future . With money being a non factor, I would gain some reassurance as I would not be spending a fortune to go and study somewhere with the fear that I chose the wrong place to study at.","Last summer was the beginning of my first college level experience. My high school partners with the neighboring Medgar Evers College in the form of the Smart Scholars program, which grants students the ability to take college courses and gain credits. The program is extremely beneficiary due to the fact that I could earn my associates degree in Biology before I even graduate high school and in turn would decrease the time I would have to spend in College. Going into the program with no prior college experience was definitely nerve-wracking. For the summer portion of the program, I was only given one class, and too add on to the pressure the course was an Eng 112 course, with english being my weakest subject. I couldn’t crumble under the pressure, I had to stay strong and work hard to do well in the class. The class was a symbol of what my college career would be like. If I put in the work I would largely benefit, so I did what I had to do, sacrificed some of my summertime and studied. In the end, I managed to pull off a well deserved A-. Not only did I learn how that sometimes you must sacrifice things to focus, but also that their a large room for improvement.","As any high school student a multitude of challenges have come to front, ones that I’ve had to face head on. Amongst those challenges, insecurity has always stood out. From the very beginning of my high school career, I was surrounded with some of the brightest minds in the school. My two best friends are generally regarded as the best of the best, the cream of the crop. Often times I found myself picking up and accumulating skills from them to improve my own academic aspirations. Habits such studying more often, creating flash cards and getting more hours of sleep largely contributed to my academic success. As the common saying says “you are the company you keep”, I owe a lot of my achievements to my two best friends, yet they’re the catalyst of my insecurities. Compared to them I’ve considered myself second rate, not able to match up to their high intellect or commitment to their scholarly work.  Jealousy is an ugly trait, being envious is even worse but sometimes I just couldn't withstand feeling inferior. Straight A’s and all the dedication in the world my friends are the epitome of academic success. On the other hand I’ve never felt I deserved to be around them, struggling to keep up with their exceptional performances. Ironically my deepest insecurities proved to be a major source of motivation. Pushing myself beyond my limits, constantly working to improve myself all areas, I proved that I could be just as smart my peers. In the long run the jealousy turned into admiration, knowing that my friends and I would take our skills and make something of ourselves. ","Working solo comes with a lot of benefits. You have time to focus without distractions from others while managing and working at your own pace. However, working in a team is the most ideal route in many situations. There will always be a time where you need help from others. For example, a group of people working together would arguably gain results faster in an experiment, as they have more hands to carry out different parts of the experiment. While it's important to have your own views and opinions, it’s very mature to learn others views and bounce them off of one another. More ideas fluctuate when they are spread around and built upon. Team work ironically also builds leadership skills. Working in teams forces you to take your own initiative and give your view on something, as well teaching you to remain headstrong despite an array of different views clashing at once. Working in a team is a great chance for people to get to know one another and develop social skills they’ll need for the real world. No matter what career choice you decide to follow, you will have to learn to work with others, even when you may not want to.

For college, I would likely try and enter one that satisfies my interest in computer science. One that would teach me skills that I would need, but time to pursue on my dream. Obstacles that might prevent me from achieving my dream may be competition. Because I am a competitive person, I may want to find ways to best someone else’s innovation. This may lead to me not innovating something new, but an alternative to what someone else created.","During the summer, I grouped up with some high school friends to work on a project. This project was to create a mobile game that would change the market, and everyone in it was very passionate.

I taught him by teaching him the logic of code, which in my opinion is the hardest part of code. We did this by creating pseudo-code, then transferring it to real code. He eventually started to take bigger parts of the role, until we ultimately finished the project.This took up a lot of my time, but we finished it and the final grade was a 93.","I prefer to work as part of a team as it is easier to develop and create ideas. You also get different perspectives on a topic, which is important because an idea which seems good for one person may be different for another. It is also more fun. My experience of working in a group include my robotics team, the teams in hackathons I attended, and my mobile game team. In hackathons, people have very different perspectives of logic, or the way a code should be run. I could remember a time where I thought the logic I thought of what perfect, that there were no flaws. However, one of my team members took me step by step on what could go wrong with my code.",3/5/2017 11:07pm,3/20/2017 11:59pm,Yes,,2,2,2,133+123+125,,6,Yes,,2017 All Star,4,10th grade,East Asian,,kliao@stuy.edu,Stuyvesant High School,Yahoo,Yes,Not Applicable,4/21/2017,Public,Oakland Gardens,Yes,Kyle,(917) 322-9165,Liao,Yes

I have always wanted to go to a religious college or university, but never had the money to get there. Another obstacle other than cost of tuition is the cost to travel there and live away from my parents here in New York and being unable to be with them face to face for months at a time. Although we do use skype, not seeing them face to face for months might be a challenge.","Last summer was a balancing act; I worked at a summer job with SYEP while attending an orientation that lasted two weeks for a program I am apart of. While I took classes in the morning, I had to take care of and teach small children in the afternoon, both babies and toddlers. Using what I learned from my orientation, I created a daily schedule using my phone to lay out the activities of my day and use it to consistently arrive at my activities each day. Having done that for the summer,  it taught me the importance of a daily routine since I had to balance my orientation schedule and my work schedule, with them both happening on the same day and having factor in external factors like food. Knowing this, I can apply this to my daily schedule with All Star Code, by scheduling time in advance both to get to the intensive and participate, but also to practice what I have done for future projects.","During my junior year, I had to struggle to pass my AP US History course. As an Advanced Placement course, it challenged me in ways I never had been before. I was challenged to be more concise and to add more depth to my work. Also at times, I would procrastinate and I would end up handing in assignments later than what I expected. In order to overcome this, I realized that I had to prioritize my work and limit my time procrastinating, while taking extra time to review my work and seeing if could improve it before I finally submitted it . As a result, I placed that class above many things on my schedule, so that I would always get it in on time and I got a better grade, an A- from a C, in that subject compared to last trimester.","Working Solo provides me with the  ability to show my individuality without having to compromise it. For example, on a recent project, I had to for AP Language, I worked alone, bouncing around ideas in mind, about how I could create a startup that would work in today’s society. One benefit that I  found was that I rarely was distracted. I work more efficiently alone since I can focus on a single task for a long time, allowing me the ability to brainstorm, without forgetting it. I could utilize this ability to work solo to maximize my experience at the intensive by using the resources given to improve my ability to work alone through program and collaboratively, to make something even bigger.

17148,Zuri Campbell,148,zuricampbell@gmail.com,Zuri,Campbell,New York City,zcampbell@williston.com,(917) 744-9537,I am very entrepreneurial. I had an EBay store that I have since closed but I still occasionally buy and sell gear to make money. I think being around other teenagers who think like me would be cool. ,"If money were no object my ideal college would be Stanford University and I would study Sports Business. I would study Sports Business because I love soccer and I love playing soccer. I know more about soccer players and teams in the Premier League than most American sports broadcasters and pundits. Your average teenager wants to be a professional athlete but I think that path is surreal because the path to becoming a professional soccer player is extremely difficult, especially if you’ve been playing in the United States all of your life. Even if it weren’t such a hard path, I am more interested in the behind the scenes of a sports franchise or club anyway. 

I want to pursue Sports Business because I believe it is a career where I can combine many of the things that I am interested in along with my love of soccer. I am entrepreneurial, I used to have my own Ebay store where I sold clothing and shoes, and I like technology. I also like negotiating which is something I do all the time when I trade and sell clothing. Right now, I have an interest in many different areas of Sports Business so I really am not sure what area I want to pursue. I would like to learn more about being an agent, recruitment, apparel and marketing.

The obstacles that might prevent me from studying Sports Business at Stanford are my grades. I am a B/C student. I would have to get stellar grades, like all As, in order to get into Stanford. I would have to give them a good reason to accept me. Also, the other obstacle would be money. Stanford is not a school where my parents could afford to send me. ","Last summer I worked at Central Park Sports, a kids sports summer camp located in Central Park. At the summer camp, I worked as a youth assistant. I managed and set up the equipment and gear for the kids. I packed all of the gear, made sure we had everything we needed, and set up the equipment and the games. Occasionally,  I biked some of the equipment in a trolley to the camp location. I also ran small errands, helped with snacks, and played with the kids. 

This job was important to me because it was my first job. I have had my own spending money in the past from selling my clothing but I wanted a real job in order to make more of my own money. I did not want to have to ask my parents for money whenever I needed it, and I also wanted to pay my parents back money that I owed them. The summer job at Central Park Sports allowed me to do that. It was also very important to me because I learned a lot of valuable lessons about working in a workplace environment. I applied all of the lessons my father taught me about being on time, not being late, proper clean up, speaking up, etc. I was able to get longer hours and more money without even asking because of my work habits. I also saw people doing things that were incorrect and I saw the consequences first hand. ","A time that I really struggled with something was when I was introduced to Pre-Algebra in middle school math. Math is a subject that I have to give my undivided attention to. In middle school, I thought differently and thought that Algebra was a small part of math and it would go away. I got way behind in class and couldn't even do simple operations like cancel-out and combine like terms. I gave up and started not doing my math homework. It piled up and the only thing I could do to get out of the hole was meet my with math teacher. 

I began coming to school early in the morning before it started to meet with my math teacher. My math teacher was very helpful and selfless. We met a lot of times to discuss the homework and I was able to ask a lot of questions. We also created an elective with two other students that met every Monday in order to get help together. Committing to this and devoting myself to the subject paid off and I made major progress. For example, one week during the math elective we reviewed the new unit ahead of time before the larger class met. I felt confident during class when I wasn’t lost and could really participate. 

My struggle in this class made me shift things into gear and apply myself more than I ever had in order to do better. This changed how I think of myself as a learner, and it changed my opinion of math. I discovered that with one-on-one help, with better focus, and with careful planning and practice, I do my best learning. After working through this, I actually enjoyed Algebra when I had it in high school the next year. The struggle helped me to know more about what helps me grow and succeed as a learner.","I prefer working as part of a team. I prefer working with a team because everyone from the group can bring something different to the table.

I am into developing applications, i.e. mobile and web. I think that this rigorous course can help me build my programming skills to a greater extent. I think this program can also help me build connections with other programmers, which is beneficial for future. ","
If money was not an object, I would go to CCNY and study computer science. CCNY is closer to my home than other great engineering schools. This means that I get to see my family more often than schools that are further away from my home. I would study computer science in college because there is an urgent need for future programmers as computer systems such as AI(Artificial Intelligence) are rising. Growing up, I have always been interested in functions of computer systems. A few years ago, I found out about programming and fell in love with it. I realize that using programming languages anything impossible can be created. This leads me to be passionate about being a programmer. Another reason is that due to shortage of programmers and workmen in other fields of computer science, there is a high demand for programmers. This means that employers are likely to continue to pay me high salary. Obstacles such as not having a good professor in college may hinder achieving my dream. Since, the material is being provided by my professors, it is important that they are able to explain the material. In the event that I do not understand something, a friendly professor might help me boost my understanding. However, if I get a professor that must teach me, and not be able to explain the material, it will become difficult. 
","Last summer I started learning HTML and some CSS to code a website. Toward the end of the summer, I started my challenge. I wanted to code a website as a fun project and see how far I could take it. As I confronted many elements that I could not figure out even through research, I moved on to other things. I finished my challenge the day before the end of the break. I was able to code a page of content. Within a very little time frame, I was able to learn a lot. It was important to me because I am passionate about being a programmer. Therefore, the more programming languages that I know about, the better programmer, the better it is for me.","I struggled keeping up my grades in school overall until 10th grade. I struggled mainly due to the fact that I did not try to make sense of the contents I was learning.  However, after many failures, I realized that I needed to change for a brighter future. I started setting small goals to improve my understanding of the contents. Eventually, I saw improvements in my gpa every marking period. I went from being a student who received 75% overall average to receiving 93% overall average. ","I prefer working as part of a team because the workload is much less. Also because through collaborations often emerge better products than working solo. I also understand that this comes as an advantage for workforce.

The first hand experience that this opportunity offers is, to me, an essential ingredient needed to better myself in Computer Science. ","John Hopokins would be a definite choice since it’s top notch in several fields of study from anthropology to neuroscience. Since money is no longer an obstacle, the greatest challenge would have to be the thought of leaving my family. I mean do I even have to? Is 200 miles really that much? Is 5 hours and 11 minutes a long commute? Alas, if I had to spend 10 hours on commute, with 8 hours on sleep, and the rest on work and study, I would soon find myself spending another hour on therapy sessions. I would study either computer science or applied mathematics since they’ve been so important to me, having spent a summer teaching it to kids and trying to show them that geometry isn’t a worthless topic. I would go into using mathematical models and their real world applications or computer science since we live in a digital world where computation is a part of our daily lives whether or not we understand it or even want to. ","Last summer, I volunteered at a school and worked at my old grade-school with teachers and kids. As a TA, I helped take a load off the teachers by grading papers and setting up activities. One moment that’s still clear in my mind is early into my job when a smart quiet 4-year old, Yan, yelled at a kid, Alex, and scared him so much that Alex pissed his pants. The teacher, Susan (yeah I call her that), handled the problem so gracefully that I couldn’t even tell what had happened. She told me that Yan got annoyed that someone was drinking from his water bottle. This really put me in my place since I’ve always thought of myself as a perfect kid (though my close friends will tell a different tale) since teachers and adults have always been so kind to me. What Yan reminded me, along with several other struggling moments with the kids, is that we tend to forget who we were and to always keep a calm open mind and not yell.","Five days is how long I would cringe in my bed while trying to obliterate my pillow with a make-shift Elder Wand over a dreaded presentation I had done in class. Having presented several times in the past, I knew what to expect of the one I was about to do for my Math Research Class for a Math Fair: a calming and hypnotic spell that would put the class into an eternal stupor. The most challenging part was the time constraint of a measly 15 minutes and that I was going to be the guy presenting because there was no time for him the day before. Luckily, my teacher let me perform a mock-presentation in front of him in an empty classroom. We were able to coordinate and bounce one-liners off each other during the class and keep everyone interested. For the first time, I felt like I earned the obligatory end-of-PowerPoint applause; amazingly that night and the following nights, I slept soundlessly. ","Group work is a teacher’s way of handing out grades without having to assess each student. For the longest time, I dreaded the thought of group work and having to teach my fellow 5th graders something new. Now years later, I definitely prefer working as a team. It lets me meet new faces and personalities ranging from a Yaroslav, the guy who contributes nothing, but says everything during the presentation, to the Stephen, the kid who does everything so that he can say nothing. Brainstorming becomes much easier, especially since there’s a whole research team ready to rip off the internet. Presenting is much easier since we have our synergistic roles and when one of us is stuttering and nervous, he can take a break and come back later, which is great for someone whose weakness is a big crowd like me. Having been in different groups for Science Olympiad and Math Team, working as a team is far better than working alone, especially since we can divide up the work for what we’re strong in.

Every year my school schedules a series of trips for the 3 language courses provided to us: Spanish, Mandarin, and French, as well as other non-language based trips. With cultural knowledge being a centerpoint in a variety of classes at Newark Academy, I decided to visit Spain and immerse myself in a culture I was interested in. The trip had opened my eyes on the history, norms, and traditions exercised in a country I never expected to visit when I was younger. I felt the trip was an important part in my high school life as it granted me a perspective that I would have never been exposed to without it. The immersion program aims to develop a globalized mindset to young minds and I felt I had achieved that through this new experience. Not only did I learn the rich history of an incredible country but I adapted to a new culture with a host family and friends. The 3 week long stay was a great way to expose my young mind in a global sense and a life changing memory that I will never forget. ","During the spring season of my Freshman year I participated in track for the 400, 200, and 4x1 events. Built on a competition of speed and endurance, seconds had insurmountable effects in a track race and success was a measurable goal I needed to work hard to reach. A strict cutoff for varsity and participation in major competitions was a challenge I was sure to work towards but difficult to achieve. Breaking my personal records of 60 seconds and 25 seconds for the 400 and 200, respectively, drove me to organize, manage, and improve over the spring track season. I chose to record each one of my races as well as every time trial I completed over the course of a 3 month period, analyzing growth, improvement, and efficiency. By recording spikes in my improvement I was able to identify the most efficient patterns and work towards achieving my goal. Nearing towards the end of the season, I had trained and disciplined myself enough to participate in several Meet of Champions competitions and establish myself as a contender for the varsity worthy competitor.","I prefer working as a part of a team because it encompasses many of the qualities that are key to a solo worker as well as exercising the qualities integral to group work. Taking leadership can exemplify the necessary traits in a productive solo worker but also shows that you are able to cooperate with others.

Group work also teaches you the skills necessary to succeed in almost any situation.

However, it would not change my perspective on applying for college, as I want to go to a college that is right for me and fits my needs and wants for an education. Specifically, I would like to enroll in either University of Southern California or Stanford University. I feel that these are both colleges that can fit my requirements but also are amazing educational institutions. I have many aspirations and goals to complete in life and want to learn as much as I can. There are many things I would like to study but I am not committed to one major yet. I would like to pursue careers in business, computer science, journalism, economics, photography, video production/filmmaking, or law. Many of these majors correlate very closely with each other, and include many of my favorite passions and hobbies. Although, I hope to achieve this dream without any obstacles, that cannot be true. I believe that the obstacles that would prevent me from completing these goals are other people and not enough time. Throughout my life, I have experienced a lot of criticism for trying to achieve my ambitions, but I have taken this as motivation and it has fueled my dedication to my goals. Time is the most valuable thing in the world, and it always seems that there is not enough of it to pursue all of my passions. ","Last summer, I worked part-time at a retail business, Westchester Wine Warehouse in White Plains. My time there was extremely beneficial to my work experience and my training within the work force. One of my passions in life has always been business and the way it is executed and accomplished. My work consisted of many different tasks that gave me insight into the retail industry. I performed duties such as helping customers out with finding certain items, stocking shelves, carrying out cases to the cars of customers, and completing a project that lasted two weeks. I was assigned the task of updating their product inventory on the program, Vision. This was one of the most grueling parts of working there because I had to insert each and every single piece of information into the system in order to effectively integrate it.  I learned a lot of valuable skills from my time at the wine store, such as, how to interact and deal with customers and how to promote a product’s selling point to a customer. I realize that the job brought out my greatest traits that I have to offer; hardworking, perseverant, and diligent. With the acquired knowledge of the business industry, I can decide whether or not I would like to pursue a career in this thriving environment and field of work. ","During my freshman year, I struggled with devoting enough time to studying and balancing my social and school life. When I got my finals grades back, I failed two of my most important finals, math and science. This really struck a chord in me and made me reevaluate my decisions and choices. Although many people would be set back after receiving grades like that, I used it as motivation to propel me into this school year, my sophomore year. I realized that college is right around the corner, and if I want to go to the best universities, I must have the best grades. I decided that I would put one hundred and ten percent into my studies and try to balance the different parts of life at the same time. When I received my first semester grades of this year, I was nervous but excited to see if all my hard work had paid off. I was extremely happy and proud of myself when I opened my semester reports, and found that all the late nights studying and extra help sessions with teachers had finally paid off. I had made the Dean's list for the first time and I did it with flying colors. I am not going to stop there though, I have set bigger and more ambitious goals for the next semester. I cannot wait to accomplish them and make myself, teachers, and parents proud again. ","As a student, I have learned my strengths and weaknesses when it comes to working on projects and assignments. As for projects, I am a huge advocate for working in groups or teams. The reasoning behind this is simple. I enjoy the method of thinking and logic in working collaboratively.

I’ve always wondered about all the amazing apps and programs that I could create, and by simply learning how to use today’s technology would be to my best advantage. I feel that participating in the All Star Code Intensive will give me a lot more exposure into programming and other technology professions and industries. Recently, I've been taking some programming classes in high school and these classes have shown me how excited coding can really be. Due to this, I'm intrigued and enthusiastic to see how much I would learn in your 6 week Intensive Summer Program. Almost everyone in this generation is learning or knows how to code which shows that coding has become an universal skill that everyone should know including me.

I would want to go to MIT because it is one of the best engineering schools in the world and offers so much that other colleges in the nation simply can’t. Also the tuition cost for MIT is practically astronomical making that the biggest obstacle for me to study at MIT, however in this situation money is not an object. MIT is also very good at helping their students find full employment jobs in their area of study right after graduating a MIT is well known to lots of tech industries. I would study Computer Science at MIT because I want to further deepen my knowledge of computer science and become a Software Engineer. I would also study Business Management because in the future I want to use programming to create something of my own like a business or company. In order to successfully do this I need instruction on how to actually carry out a business. An obstacle that may prevent me from obtaining this dream is the competition involving getting accepted to MIT, as the acceptance rate is less than 10 percent. This is such a big obstacle because so many eligible and capable students in the nation apply to MIT that have great credentials, this makes the admission process so selective and makes many students doubtful of getting accepting. However, I will do whatever to increase my odds of getting into MIT.","Something that I did last summer that was important to me, was that I participated in an internship/mentorship program at Microsoft. At Microsoft I received so much knowledge and exposure to different applications of engineering that help advance society from my mentors and various lab experiences. During this program I learned a lot about cloud technology and different implementations of it. By the end of the program me and and a group of other special individuals worked on a project to develop something that would improve quality for cloud customers. The people that I met there have taught me significant life lessons and have really conveyed to me that anything is possible as long as you put your mind to it, as I like to say 'mind over matter!"". As some of the people I encountered had difficult backgrounds but where able to surpass that and still be on a path to reach their dreams and aspirations. This program has also helped me developed a more business professional mindset giving me exposure to the business world and the necessary tools to properly succeed. For example, one important lesson I learned was to seize every opportunity at hand because there may not be other one like it. This stayed in my mind daily helping me make connections with individuals and making me more open-minded to my surroundings and environment. My experience at Microsoft was so unique and life-changing because I was able to encounter things that I have never witnessed or even thought of prior to attending the program.","A time where I struggled with something was at the beginning of my sophomore year when I was having a lot of trouble in Algebra 2. One of the reasons why Algebra 2 was challenging at first was because I was prepared poorly in middle school during Algebra 1 so this would most likely make Algebra 2 challenging from the start. Another thing that made Algebra 2 challenging was that my teacher knew the material very well but didn’t really explain it all that well and this was reflected in the average test scores of his class. Due to this, I went to my teacher for 1 to 1 tutoring before my first period a lot and sometimes after school to other Algebra 2 teachers for help on specific problems on past homework and class work. I would do this because getting a different perspective to solving a problem or learning a concept surprisingly helped me a lot in mastering the topic. I also told my teacher my situation in Algebra 1 so that he’d know what to go over or spend more time on. Additionally, I started preparing for exams more efficiently. I did this by not trying to overload information in my head the night before my tests which was what I had been doing for my previous tests instead I gave myself days before to study everyday and go over everything I needed to in tutoring or by looking to a friend to help me and to maybe study with. In turn this method worked out for me in Algebra 2. ","I prefer working solo because I'll have the freedom to express any idea that comes to mind into my project. For example, when working as part of a team you must assemble all the ideas of everyone in the group to make it unbiased and show teamwork which may result in conflict and/or frustration. However, while working solo you have complete liberty to create the project or assignment exactly how you please. Furthermore, by working solo I know that the result of the project or assignment is my responsibility and why I obtained the result I did. Also just because you’re working solo, doesn't mean you can’t ask for feedback, other tips or ideas from others to help strengthen your project. When given projects, I really enjoy brainstorming and collaborating with other peers. Additionally, I feel that while working solo it’s easier to concentrate and focus effectively because I won’t have to shift and change decisions so much, compared to working in a group where ideas and decisions are constantly thrown around and it becomes hard to come to one neutral conclusion. It also depends on the task given because some tasks are better handled by working independently while others are obviously better handled by working as part of a team because more work can be accomplished when everyone pulling together.  For example, something I'm apart of in my school is NSBE(National Society of Black Engineers) and I am on the NSBE executive board now. Where we have to work as a team or we wouldn't be able to even accomplish a large majority of things we have, if we didn't work as a team. In total, I am very comfortable working in both a team and solo.",3/6/2017 12:58am,3/20/2017 11:59pm,Yes,,2,2,1,134+126+133,,5,Yes,,Rejected ASC Offer,4,11th grade,"African American, Hispanic/Latino",,,Brooklyn Technical High School,,No,No,,Public,New York City,Yes,Dionne,(646) 265-3102,Papino,

I am great at manipulating numbers through the power of enumeration so I could find an algorithm for a lot of things.,"If money were no object, I would go to college at Williams College and I would study mathematics and its applications. Williams is a liberal arts college, where I can learn about different subjects and more applications for math. In my life, teachers and parents gave to me all of the wisdom to solve math problems. For example, the most important piece of wisdom is realistic math problems always yield answers. Now I have immense talent for math and I want to use this talent to give back. The world needs more people who can understand algebra, the language of the physical world and technology.
I haven’t decided what career path I should take with my math expertise. I’ve had dreams of working for a think tank and using statistics to prove to people the truth, defeating their ignorance. With more truthful statistics in the world, people will make better decisions. Second, I could use my math expertise to be a chemist and help create engines that operate from renewable energy sources. For example, in an engine that runs from solar energy, I would need a compound or element that could move the maximum amount of electrons to an electric engine from the amount of light coming from the sun. Finally, I could be a computer scientist and analyze data all day with my math expertise. I could create programs that recreate the numbers and figure out the meaning of all of the data to help companies, think tanks, small businesses, or regular people.
The obstacles that might prevent me from achieving the dream are if I have a family or if I have to be present for friends. My family comes first so if I have to be at an important event for my family my dream will have to be on hold. Important events include milestones or some days of regular life so my family knows I do like to be with them. The same goes for my friends.  Otherwise, nothing will prevent me from achieving the dream. I know those words can be easily broken, but I will try to stick to them as much as possible.","Last summer, I went on a World War I and World War II history trip to France, Germany, and Poland that focused on the Holocaust, museums, and visits to former concentration camps. Even though it was a history trip, the most important part was being exposed to European culture. However, I loved all of the historical information. I was the only student to read the entire packet the teacher assigned to us. The packet discussed the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime and some of the reasons why Hitler was placed into office.
	We had a tour guide for the trip named Michele. As a native German man, he told us about European culture, where people sit at restaurants and spend more time socialize instead of eating and then leaving, which I found interesting.  He also mentioned that Germany has five or six major political parties.
 I noticed important things too. On the highway in Germany the speed limit was 70 km/h. When converting into miles, the limit is 43.4 miles per hour. That is really slow compared to America’s 65 miles per hour speed limit. I also noticed on the highway that some rest stops made fresh food in front of customers such as pasta with meatballs compared to fast food chains at America’s rest stops.
 Next, I noticed the old style Gothic architecture in Paris that dates back to before the creation of the United States. I favor the Gothic architecture over all of the bricks in New England because it takes a lot more skill to make the buildings Gothic buildings than the brick ones. 
Experiencing the culture of Europe was important because it filled my mind with new ideas of how life could be lived. America is not the only model. I wonder if other countries have better models compared to America in civil fields, political fields, or education.","AP Computer Science has taught me a lot. Even though I have only taken the class for half of a year, now I feel like I can code anything. I developed a great process for writing programs. The process is to spend a lot of time in the problem decomposition, make sure the idea is logical, and come up with formulas to solve each little step. Then I begin to code the first step from the decomposition. After the step is coded, I test the step by running the program. If the step is correct, then I move onto the next step and repeat until the program is finished. If the step is not correct then I know the problem is with the newly created code. Next, I will check the debugger for the type of error or I will completely check through the step and fix the problem. After the code is correct, I repeat the process with new code until I finish the program. I did not learn this process from the teacher. It took a whole trimester of awful grades from assignments and from tests to get this great process. Now I currently have a 93 average. 

	Specifically I struggled through a test and a project to get my process. On the test, I had no idea how to get a correct formula for a method that extracts digits from numbers with a parameter of which digit to extract. This is easy with the String class because in Java I could use the method indexOf to find the correct index of the digit, next I could use the substring method to specifically get the digit, and then I could return the digit. However, the test asked me to extract digits using operations from the primitive type int. No one in the class answered this problem correctly and my teacher offered points back on the question for a correct algorithm. The problem seemed impossible, but I sought for a solution. I went to multiple extra help sessions to determine an answer for this problem. I looked at every case and tried to combine it all into one formula. I had fears of not getting back those points and I battled them. Eventually I ended up solving every case and combining the solutions into one giant formula. I received the points back and I was ecstatic. 
	However, the fear of failure consumed my mind on the project. I wrote the entire code without checking any parts, so when there was a lot of errors I was confused because my idea was logical. The confusion plus my fear of failure paralyzed me from finding a solution. The problem became impossible. I needed to use two extensions (an extra two days over the weekend) to try to determine an answer. I was lucky to find my advisor. He took A.P. Computer Science too and when he saw my code he told me to remember problem decomposition and look through every method of my problem. My paralysis faded, I rewrote the code, found some mistakes and mostly finished the assignment. Afterwards, I killed my paralysis. I realized to not get trapped in my belief that since the idea of the code is logical then the code is valid. The only thing that matters if if the computer thinks the code is valid so when writing code always check what the computer is given so it creates the right product.
	On the project and the test, I tackled problems I deemed impossible. To solve the problems I found a process to solve problems and now I’ll never get stuck again. If I do then I will fall back on my process and never let fear and confusion make me paralyzed again. ","I prefer working in a team. I still believe in each member pulling his or her own weight, but when a person is stuck it is important that another member of the team can help the person solve the problem. If a person works alone then the he or she needs to solve his or her own problems and sometimes it is not possible without a lot of time. Furthermore, if a person needs to relax then the team can relax together and they will make each other’s mental state positive through the companionship. With positive mental states, the team will be able to then positively return to work well rested. If a person is alone they may become lonely after working hard. The person will have to look for a companion and that may take longer than a quick break, making the person waste time. Finally, I like working with a team because in school I hardly ever work on a team or if I am on a team other people do not pull their weight. So, I want to keep working on teams until I find a team where we all equally pull our weight and we do as well as we can.

Further, access to individuals who have attended these institutions are far and few between based on where I come from, so attending an elite institution would serve to propel my family and I out of some of the financial constraints we currently experience. 
 If I were to attend Harvard I would study computer science and music because my passion is music and I also hope to pursue a career in computer science. On another note, attending an “elite” institution allows me to serve as an inspiration to other Black and Latino kids in my community --my goal is to encourage them to pursue their dreams with fervency, not only to satisfy their own personal ambitions but also to impact the community at large. The only obstacle that may come in the way of achieving this goal is the lack of academic resources in my community and good mentorship.","Last summer I participated in the Summer Youth Employment Program as a camp counselor to children ages 2-14.

My goal is to become a neurosurgeon who integrates computer science with neuroscience with the goal of radically changing the word. I aspire to be on the cutting edge of new technologies that can enhance brain research, aid with locating brain and spinal cord tumors, and help us get a better understanding of the most complex organ in the human body. A few years ago, I took a medical neuroscience course on Coursera and henceforth I have been in love with the brain. The thought of cutting open a skull, pealing back the meninges (the outer lining of the brain), and witnessing its external beauty while functioning is completely amazing. Additionally, computers have always captured my attention. I have visited Harvard and M.I.T. on numerous occasions and absolutely love them both. The campus and the environment of the schools are perfect for me. I have yet to visit Stanford but in my imagination I fit right in. I feel pretty confident about becoming a neurosurgeon and striving to change the world through neuroscience and computer science. I’m fascinated by both topics and I am immensely determined to achieving this goal.","My seventeen year old brother (Rusty) and I established a free, weekly, three hour, summer, Saturday math and literacy program, where we tutored students in these fundamental subjects. After reading an article stating that math and literacy rates, among African-Americans, males in particular, were at crisis levels, we thought, “What can we do to change this,” because the article really touched us being that we are African American males. We decided to start a free program where we would teach students core mathematical and grammatical concepts such as the eight parts of speech,112 classifications of the english language, phrases, clauses, cubes, squares, the four laws of math, memorization of the times tables one-fifteen, engage them in reading books we found interesting, and help them really understand there homework by providing plenty of problems in class concerning the concepts they were learning. We asked our parents if we could host the summer session in the ground floor of our house. They responded,“Certainly!”, after hearing our plans for the space. The program was amazing! Every week we were hearing “If I only understood this then, I would've aced my math class” or “I get it now; I finally understand.” The rapid progress of our students excited and ensure to us are program was working. Furthermore, our project has gained lots of positive feedback. Several professional writers and English teachers in and around our neighborhood have offered to volunteer in our upcoming spring session, which is really exciting. "," In the fall of 2016, my brother (Rusty) and I went to Harvard University to participate in Harvard’s annual mock trial seminar. We thought it was phenomenal and were eager to sponsor students from our community through our non profit organization, the Rusty and River Fields Foundation, to attend the upcoming session in four weeks. Originally we planned to sponsor four students but that number quickly grew to ten and before we knew it, we had forty local teens signed up. With merely four weeks to raise $15,000 to cover the cost of transportation, accommodation, and participation in the event, we pulled out our drawing board and outlined our fundraising strategy, as our greatest challenge was raising the money to sponsor the students. After the first week of soliciting donations from family members, friends, local churches and stores, we assessed how we did. We realized we were far from our goal. We raised $978 when nearly four thousand was our target. Now with three weeks left to raise $14,000, we took a deep breath, immediately whipped out our white board, and began brainstorming. For three hours we were just proposing ideas (create a go fund me campaign, write letters to major companies, local media, elected officials, etc.). We then organized the applicable ideas and disposed of the rest. For the next three weeks we aggressively fundraised executing our strategies. We surpassed our goal of $15,000, received several write-ups and video coverage from newspapers and news stations, was awarded a citation and $1,000 from Brooklyn Borough President Eric L. Adams, and  successfully took our forty students to Harvard’s remarkable 2016 November mock trial session.","“Team work makes the dream work, but a vision becomes a nightmare when the leader has a big dream and a bad team.” I couldn't have worded this better myself.

Ive been to a couple coding workshops in the city including the boys and girls clubs' apple coding workshop. I am the CoCaptain of the FRC Robotics Team 1660, the Harlem Knights.

It was because I have a fascination with weapons and the military in general. I had the whole ""guns are awesome"" phase in elementary school, and what better place to learn how they work and build cool stuff, than the military. Since high school started I wanted to be an engineer.  So although I would love to study mechanical engineering and or weapon development at West Point, it's not a dream of mine anymore. I wouldn't do it because it's not a career path I want  to take, making weapons. I definitely want to be a mechanical engineer though, however I've also always had a passion for music and performing arts. Oberlin College has become a top school for me because it offers both music and dance along with a good engineering program. I doubt there is anything that would prevent me from going to this college and studying mechanical engineering and music, other than my obviously ever changing passions and interests. ","My school's robotics team has 2 rooms, 108 and 109. However the space  wasn't completely accessible 2 years ago. Our machine room, 109, had at least a ton, (literally), of scrap wood, metal, woodshop tables and machines, old broken lockers, and chemicals in containers, so we couldn't really use the room to the fullest. We honestly used about 25% of the space because that's all we had access to, since the room originally doubled as a janitor storage.  So in the summer of 2016 I got an email from my coach, Mr Bianchi, to help clear out that room. Over the course of 3 days a few teammates and I, and Mr Bianchi spent around 18 hours dismantling, sorting, carrying and dumping hundreds of pounds of useless materials from room to dolly to dumpster outside. It was quite honestly back-breaking work. Now that we made room, we have another organisation, Elite, which is a stem outreach  program, occasionally use the back corner portion of the room while we occupy the rest. We have our tables, 3D printers CNC machine, and soon-to-be-operational lathe set up, as well as tool ""sheds"" and table saw now set up. It's made a tremendous difference in the efficiency in which the stem classes and the robotics team can complete their tasks. This initial renovation is so important to me because I love the robotics team and as Co-captain it makes me feel good to help make the rooms better for us all. It also helps because I take 2 of the various stem classes in my school, which are mostly based in 108 and 109. We seek to further renovate and improve 109 and 108 and I plan to do more over this summer as well. ","Since around 3rd grade I've struggled with depression. I haven't the slightest idea as to why. At a young age I had that famous ""I'm an insignificant creature living on a floating rock whose bound to die and fade into blackness"". It sounds silly but from then on I just couldn't really enjoy solitude or life without distraction. Sometimes it hits me and it drastically affects my performance and work ethic. I've had counseling and all, and I've come to the conclusion that extracurriculars and programs and even school, are sort of my cure. When I have something to worry about other than myself I perform better overall because now I have to solve problems and think and input. I'm a great critical thinker and problem solver so when I face problems and activities that require thought I tend to excel. But when my programs end I fall into a slump. which Is why I resort to gaming, or casual coding, or playing an instrument. So my struggle is an ongoing one, but I combat it everyday and try to be as happy and cheerful a person as possible. I love to make others smile and feel good so I don't let my depression define who I am. ","I'm an ambiverted person, so I don't mind being around people, but at the same time I like being by myself occasionally. When It comes to classwork  or busywork I prefer to work alone because it's a lot easier to pace myself when I don't have to divide the work and rely on someone else to do their part. So if anything goes wrong I have no one to blame but myself. I can figure out what I need to do and revise it and go with my own approach to it without compromise. However in some instances such as large projects I do well in a group with creative and innovative people, because I work well with likeminded people. Because usually in groups I'm paired with people who I either have to reteach the assignment to or don't carry their own weight so it drags me down too. In all, my preference depends on the people available and the complexity of the assignment.

I am interested in studying these fields because I believe that the future of our job market is oriented around technical fields such as computer science and engineering. I think that being a black youth in some ways limits my opportunities to become successful in such fields, so programs like All Star Code are chances for me to make up for this deficiency. I want to go to these schools because they both have great engineering programs. These programs can help me prepare for work in these fields and open up opportunities for postgraduate education. A few other obstacles that stand between my goals and I are the costs of education and my inexperience in certain STEM areas. College can be very expensive and I feel a pressure to get scholarships and financial aid to fulfill my dream. All Star Code can help me get the experience I need that can take my experience to a new level. ","Last summer I worked for a real estate company in New York City for 8 weeks. The work was important to me because it gave me a few insights into how the real estate market. Furthermore, it gave me a taste of independence and the real world. As I grow up people don't always point me in the right direction. I’ve had to figure things out on my own such as money management and organization. The most important thing that I learned from this job is how to maintain a tight budget and manage my personal budget. It was important because it taught me a number of broad and applicable lessons that aren’t otherwise being taught in my school. ","Robotics has been one of the interesting clubs I've joined in my school. It's not just one person working on a whole project alone. We're essentially a team that come together for one common goal, but everyone essentially has a designated job. And our goal is to use our engineering concepts in which we have learnt to build projects and robots. Some troubles I face are errors with code, mechanical issues with the robot and more. I could have given up but I always choose to continue because I understand that the end product if far more valuable than the troubles. I go through the struggles with creative ideas to solve the problem at hand. The most rewarding part is seeing my ideas being executed in real life. The end goal is much more important to me so I persevere to get it done.","I strongly believe that a team runs and works efficiently with a group of people instead of just one person. This makes me prefer to work together as a team,creativity will help better ideas come to fruition.

In my robotics team we work together in different groups such as mechanical fabrication, business, electrical, drivetrain, and programing group. I'm able to go from group to group to discuss various topics concerning our project and ways to benefit our team .

I am convinced that I need this program to help me grow and develop socially, academically, personally and otherwise. I also need a structured summer where I can be involved in gainful activities. I want to have increased academic engagement and performance and learn more about the growth mindset that will benefit me, not just this summer but for the rest of my life. I would also bring into the program my talents, enthusiasm and great effort. ","If money were no object, I would go to Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT. I love Science and Technology. I am particularly interested in Medical Science and Technology. I always dreamed of being a surgeon and using Robotic Technology to assist me in performing surgical procedures. I think I can save lives and help many people have a better quality of life. My interest in robotics and science goes way back to elementary school where I was programmer and captain of the Robotics team. At my present school, I am on the Robotics team and I am actively involved in building and programming robots. Making things work and fixing things have always fascinated me. I love the challenge. The only obstacle that may stand in my way of achieving this dream is the rigorous and competitive admissions process for MIT. However, if I keep my grades and academic performance high then I will have a better chance at overcoming this obstacle.","Last summer I did four weeks of enrichment academic classes with the Oliver Scholars program and thereafter I went on a trip to Rhode Island with the Fresh Air Fund for two weeks of fun and adventure. During the 4 weeks at Oliver Scholars, I did intense work in Science, English and Math. This was important to me because it gave me a head start on the rigorous courses offered at my school. I believe that to achieve any goal, one must work hard. I also believe that there must be a balance between social and academic life also. On the Rhode Island trip, I had fun on the beach, camp sites, museums, gardens parks, etc. For my enjoyment, it was very important to me to have two weeks of fun and adventure after 4 weeks of intensive academic preparation for 10th grade course work. After the 2017 Summer Intensive, I would love to go back to Rhode Island.","
At school, a group of us were responsible for building a robot and field elements. We each had different roles. At one point I was responsible for building a bridge and door as part of the field elements. This was especially challenging for me since at that time, I had more experience at programming than building, it was time sensitive and I also had to use tools I had never seen or used before. I decided to put in extra time doing research and learning to use the tools. During my free periods and after school I spent extra time on that project. I also asked my robotics teacher and team mates for help when I really needed it. I learnt to advocate for myself. I understood and utilized the power of team work.  We all ended up recognizing and appreciating each other’s strengths and helping each other on the individual part of the project. At the end, this was a great accomplishment for me and I believe that was because of the many challenges I overcame.","Sometimes I have been required to work as part of a team and other times as an individual. Although I have been very successful when working alone I prefer to work with a team. From my experience as part of a highly successful robotics team in elementary school and taking part in crew as a sport in my current school teamwork in extremely rewarding and fulfilling and beneficial to the members of the team. 
One reason I prefer working in a team is that every member will bring his unique strengths and insights to the project. This enables issues and problems to be addressed and resolved in a timely manner. Team members can double check each other work which leads to greater accuracy and reduced errors. Another positive experience I have with working in a team is the way team members motivate each other to achieve a common goal. I enjoy the friendships developed when working on a project. Some friendly rivalry can also go a long way in encouraging me in push a little bit more and achieving more than I previously thought I am capable of doing. Overall I find working in a team helps me achieve more than working individually, increasing my discipline and productivity.

Something that might prevent me from achieving my dream is the technology part because I am new to programming and I am not very good at it. That is why I want to do ASC because it will help improve my technology skills. ","Last summer I was apart of a program called Rutgers Upward Bound. It was my second year doing the program and it was a very memorable experience.

Therefore with very high hopes, I hope to be able to find and keep the zeal, drive, motivation and inspiration to never give up coding. Secondly, I believe this program can help reassure me to why this passion chose me and aspire me to do more in the future. I believe this program can help rekindle and aspire me to follow my dreams.  Furthermore, I believe this program can help me gain better overall knowledge and help equip me accordingly. Lastly, I am very interested in meeting new people, friends and faces who are all interested in doing similar things; as a source of networking.","If money were no object I would definitely and enthusiastically got M.I.T. to study Software /Hardware Engineering. I chose this career path because, I do feel as see it as a calling rather than future profession. There is great enthusiasm and passion for computer science ever since I first wrote my first line of code. Some obstacles that may prevent me from reaching this goal are the resources and opportunity. As a under informed young man, whose school gives no extracurricular related to my future career/passion, I do myself the proactive favor of looking for resources outside my school. I do believe that if the resources are utilized properly, opportunities follow. For this and many other reasons, I have taken it upon myself to minimize my chances of failure by exposing myself to internships programs that helps me network and solidify my passion for the computer sciences. Furthermore, my two year old sister is currently battling for her life against leukemia. This obstacle may sidetrack me, plummet my grades, and might drain me psychologically. This can prevent me from achieving my goals because, it directly affects my grades which might also affect my chances of getting into a good college since money and grades go hand in hand in college applications.","Something I did last summer that was very important to me was an internship I participated in called CodeNow. This program fully engaged me with the hands on coding experience that broadened my knowledge on software engineering. We used Cloud9 to create various games, programs such as hangman, Hi-Lo, and much more complicated activities. Without this experience, it is safe to say I would’ve been oblivious and ignorant to certain things concerning computer science. In the program we created 3- 6 different programs depending on the level of the individual and their group and wrote codes to execute various commands. This program also enlightened me to why I really enjoyed coding.  It weren’t about the product necessarily, (not that I didn’t enjoy the product) it were about the process. More so, it wasn’t about the codes we wrote that were successfully running, it was the teamwork, approach, dedication (through passion) and endorphins that rushed through our veins whenever we figured out the solution to an obstacle we were challenged with.","At the age of 14 I was a very athletic young lad who did almost everything. As normal as this may sound, my body was still under construction from teen developments. (Breakout, growth) All matters short, I had developed a condition called Osgood Schlatter disease in teens. So it is basically when your leg bone and thigh bone grind on each other because there is little to no cartilage in between both due to the fact that the foot and knee is simply growing rapidly or stops growing at all. (Which is sort of a natural/good thing). So during soccer practice, there was severe swelling in my knee, and I got kicked out the game. Later on, I and my parents went to the doctor who diagnosed me with Osgood Schlatter. Moving on, my team had advanced and we had a really big game in about 3 weeks. I was apart of a bigger community that functioned well as a team. So doctors told my mom it will potentially take years to heal because the normal thing to do it to just allow the body to develop with some support from orthopedic exercises and to not play any games. So therefore, my importance on the team had depreciated because I was of no use, correct? Wrong. Although, my foot was all jammed, I had a knee brace and walking clutches which enabled me to move and that was enough for me. I had helped my team with errands, training and my coach with assistance. With rigorous orthopedic routines, (that no one else should really try) I was up and ready in less than 3 weeks and ready for the big game. Like singer Lisa Lopes once said, “Energy never dies, it only transforms” I had not given up myself but only changed the sort of importance I was going to be of the team till full recovery. As a proud young man, I am happy to still use this motto to date. The lesson I learned here was that, although you may be incapable to do something, give it your best and the best is enough to put you through any obstacles.
","I truly enjoy and prefer working as part of a team. I’d say teamwork because, It is fair to say no one is perfect So what teamwork does is that, it helps people strengthen their teammate’s weakness. A perfect analogy/proverb to help solidify my reasoning is a chain is as strong as its weakest link. With an ‘’incapable” teammate, the whole team may be incapable of finishing but, when the team comes together and helps the less knowledgeable person, the whole team grows and becomes more efficient. Teamwork also promotes responsibility and also helps a person with self-analysis. In order words, it helps others realize their capabilities and build on their weaknesses. Teamwork guarantees people to learn new things. For example, someone on the team may know how to splice codes and you were assigned to work on the same task with the individual with the knowledge. Although you may incapable at first, the experience will force you to learn.

I am looking forward to studying astrophysics, or aerospace engineering. Since I was five years old, I always liked to look at the night sky for stars. Since then, I've always been thinking about space, stars and the cosmos. Astrophysics is my way of learning more about the cosmos as well as deeply studying it. Aerospace engineering allows me to take a similar approach. I can work on air related projects, as well as learning how to make things suitable for that environment, whether its just inside our atmosphere, or beyond it. This dream is going to be very rather difficult for me as this university is in Texas. If I do get accepted, I would have to make the very difficult decision of leaving behind my parents and family here in New Jersey and potentially not seeing them again for a very long time. In my culture, family unity is crucial. I already left most of my family in Ecuador when I came to this country at nine years old, and I wouldn't want to do it again.","Last summer I made a trip that I find the most important out of everything I did then. I have a family of four: my parents, my brother and me. They are mostly very busy, working hard to support themselves as me, just like any caring family would. Because of this, though, we are share time together. My father leaves early in the morning and comes back late night, my mother also leaves early and comes back late noon and my brother is home the morning but then only comes back to sleep. As a family, we have very little time to ourselves. Last summer, we decided to go on a family trip for a week. This was an unforgettable trip, one that brought us back together and reminded us of our family values. As Latinos who gave up their life to all come here for the first time, it is hard to maintain our culture and values in this fast paced country. Last summer was our last summer together, at least for a while. Now that I am looking forward to college, my summers won't be as family friendly as we would like them to be.","Currently I am enrolled in two challenging classes: AP Calculus AB and AP Physics. Both of these subjects are very tough and the amount of workload that they give me is very cumbersome as well. Each one of these classes require a lot of my time, effort and attention, but there is two of them, making focusing on just one of them impossible. Early in the year I tried focusing on one of them, and not do so good on the other one, then alternate. Of course, this was not the way to go, but these were my first really challenging classes and I was learning how to cope with them. I struggled constantly until I finally found a way to balance these classes. As time went on, I devoted much more of my attention to these classes. I began doing work for the next day on my free periods for my other classes and once I got home, I would only pay attention and study constantly for the rest of the day for my AP classes. This also added to my distancing of my family, but they understood me and wanted me to excel in this very important year.","I prefer working in a team. Solo assignments are fine, but I think that teamwork can always bring the final product of the work to its full potential. People are different.

I would want to go to these institutions not simply because they are acclaimed as prestigious but because they are leaders in pioneering research and it’s a community that is invigorated towards new pursuits; the unknown is a frontier yet to understand and that challenge is met with open arms but social impact at these campuses is still driven. Helping the people is vital while also pushing your own limits and boundaries to serve the general innovation and pushing forth of knowledge into new plains of uncharted territory.","Last summer I spent two weeks at a program hosted at Columbia. And while two weeks isn’t a sizeable chunk of time, it was fundamental in my growth as a person. The program was centered around the basics of web development and game development, however, it took a different approach and changed how these developments could be applied to social issues. Every project that we did was an attempt to fix a social issue that plagued society, whether it be the growing Islamophobia in post 9-11 America or wage gaps in the workplace or even the issues surrounding retired, neglected veterans. Our end projects consisted of both, designing a website (on our own) and drafting a prototype of a game (in a group), which was to help fix these social issues. My website wasn’t that advanced, it contained simple HTML and CSS components but it’s purpose was to serve the education of groups on what exactly Islam is in order to dispel the malignant connotations that arise when bringing up the idea of being Muslim. This insistence on combining social issues with even the most basic of STEM skills sparked an interest and development of this philosophy within me that civil liberties and addressing of social issues need to go hand in hand with the progression of STEM and inventions that ‘stem’ from that. Additionally, in the group project we worked on addressing the issue of gentrification that had engulfed a large portion of Brooklyn and was evident in the neighborhood of Columbia, where there were such distinct differences between Columbia and Harlem, no matter how close they were to each other. This program also helped me become much more aware of what privilege I have, even if it is smaller in comparison to others and how I need to help others climb while I am also climbing. ","When I was working on the gentrification project with the rest of the members of my team, I faced difficulty in working together because of the constant clash of ideas and the different directions we wanted to take the board game in, or at times, the lack of direction for the board game. There were many long nights where we would only get two hours of sleep because we were so busy arguing over what we wanted the project to be that we had very little time to completely finish our first prototype. But we eventually accomplished it with clear ideas as to what we wanted, even if our final project was not completely finished. What I took away from this long endeavor in the creation of our project and working in a team rests on a few things. 1. All ideas need to be considered, no matter how ridiculous they sound because innovation is driven by ideas that aren’t necessarily the first to come to mind. 2. How to be diplomatic in pitching ideas forward to other members and how to work with a team so that no one feels left out because everyone is part of the machine. And finally, how to bond with your team members so at the end of the day it doesn’t feel like grueling work but you’re doing the project because you want to do the project.","I would prefer working in a team because taking others ideas and applying them to a bigger picture speeds up the process of working and enhances the product significantly, once ideas are agreed upon. Additionally, there is a lot of accountability by other members and hard work by one member of the team towards a strongly desired goal (strongly desired by everyone on the team) usually speeds up the process of everyone else. A team’s biggest strength is definitely how tightly knit the members of the team can be. The stronger the friendships between the members the more unified they can be and the more productive and resultantly, the more fun it is to be working on the project, rather than just systematically moving about, trying to solve various issues without the redeeming quality of doing the project should have. Teams are a great way to change your thinking and experience new ways of thought by others. That’s why I would prefer working as part of a team rather than by myself.

Most organizations have taken an interest in female minorities leaving the rest of us who would like to pursue a career in software left out. I've taken a computer science course in my current school and ever since I started to learn the basics of javascript I've had an insatiable curiosity to learn as much as I can about programming languages. I also feel that All Star Code will give me very valuable insight of the technology businesses and that would be a very large step in the right direction if I ever want to achieve my dream of opening my own technology business.,"If money were not a thing I would probably go to MIT for one or two decades. I love to learn about different things and see the world through new perspectives. I would be heavily involved with all the campus’s activities and try to meet as many people as possible because I honestly believe that every single human being has something to offer me that I can learn from. After I tire out of the MIT campus in a few decades or so, I will leave the university and just travel the world. I would love to meet people from different cultures and learn about their struggles but also about their joys in life. I would love to study past civilizations and current indigenous tribes or just hang out with them for a while until I plan my next destination. Only obstacle I could see myself encountering is missing my friends and family while away and/or when having all my time consumed by the MIT life.","Last summer I downloaded an app called Duolingo. It’s a language learning app. I had caught an interest for the language of Portuguese. I think that Portuguese is a beautiful language and would definitely help me out if I ever travel to South America or Europe. Every day I would sit down and learn a little. It wasn’t as hard as I expected because I already knew how to speak and write in Spanish and the languages are similar in a sense. My family thought it was pointless because I don’t have any friends who speak the language but that just fueled the fire in me to learn. When summer ended I slowly stopped studying more and more as school work got in the way. I’m not fluent in Portuguese, but at least I had an exposure to it and as long as I feel like I attained a little bit of knowledge and still have that motivation to learn every now and then I would look into it and expand my understanding of it.","The biggest challenge I’ve faced would probably be that one time I missed a whole week of school. I missed school because I wanted to attend chess nationals in Atlanta. When I came back and looked at my grades online, I saw so many missing assignments. I had an overall average of 75 compared to the 95 I usually have. I started scheduling conferences with my teachers and asking for the work that I might have missed. I did some of the work at lunch, after school in classrooms, and for homework. I stood after school for an hour every day for two weeks making up the work. My teachers were very generous and let me earn all the credit that I had missed. I managed to finish the semester with a 4.0 average!",I love to work in groups. I love the feelings of sharing ideas and learning new things together. I can learn from my group as much as they can learn from me. I love not having all the responsibility and splitting the work evenly between members. The only obstacles that I would say comes with working in groups would be creative differences or differences in ideas and when some people fail to do their part. When I work in groups I always get the member’s numbers so I can text them and make sure they do their part. When it comes to differences in ideas I would try to find common ground. I would listen to their ideas and then I would present my idea in a peaceful manner. We will then edit our ideas until we can come up with a compromise.,3/7/2017 12:28am,3/20/2017 11:59pm,Yes,,2,2,2,909+133+108,Definite yes!+,6,Yes,,2017 All Star,4,10th grade,"Hispanic/Latino, Caribbean",,elvisvasq06@gmail.com,Manhattan Hunter Science High School,Bond,Yes,Yes,4/14/2017,Public,Bronx,Yes,Lenny,(347) 781-7575,Santana,Yes

I believe All Star Code will not only help further my knowledge in coding, but also give me the necessary experience to excel in my ambitions. Coding truly inspires me! I realized that nearly everything we use on a daily basis is intertwined with computing and coding, and this really makes me want to pursue the field more, as I believe anyone has the power to benefit society with technology, even me. I hope to live by Confucius's words, ""Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.” Ultimately, I believe this program can equip me with core leadership skills, real world experience, coding knowledge, and a lot of fun!","	If money were no object, I would attend Cornell University.  I chose Cornell University because it is closer to New York City, which is where I was born and long to live again. I also have family near by who can check up on me and help me with any problems I have. Another plus to that is it gives my mom a ease of mind, so she wouldn’t have to panic of my whereabouts. In addition Cornell is tied 6th for the best computer science in the united states making it a perfect place for me to study the field I would like to pursue.Being such a such a prestigious school, the reputation will not only help me look for future internships and jobs but my own reputation.  Besides New York is an amazing place to be a college student, due to the fact there is opportunities everywhere to build your character, résumé, and career.
 My field of study would be computer science. The reason for this choice is because with computer science you can truly make a positive difference in the world and with a unimaginative level of creativeness and innovation. Furthermore if I want to live in New York City, a remarkable place but expensive living cost, this field would be great since it has one of the highest paid and highest satisfaction rates in  computing jobs.  I find things that are unchallenging boring,  this being said computer science really challenges you by enabling you to solve complex problems. In addition if I decide not to pursue in computer science in the future, it wouldn't be considered a waste of time. 
Obstacles that might prevent me from achieving my dreams could be my previous experiences and lack of experience. In my early high school years and middle school years I would be very unmotivated in becoming successful and my grades made it only worse. So I realized I needed to change or else my life would spiral out of control and go downhill. So with better work ethic and determination I believe I can correct my previous mistakes. Another obstacle could be a lack of experience, since nowadays companies and colleges look more for experience, since they know retaining knowledge is different for everyone and the true way to tell if a someone knows what they are doing is by experience. For example two students can have a 4.0 GPA, one could have cheated his way through while the other could've worked hard and studied, but once the interviewer checks their experience they will see who knows what they're doing, Overall I believe experience could be hindrance of my dreams, but if I work hard to gain it will help and even possibly cover up my past hiccups.","One thing I did last summer that was very important was attend Bridge Builders. Bridge Builders is a conference where selected students spend a whole week in a college campus without any type of electronics. We were split up into teams and they teams were designed to be diverse and paired with different schools around the cities. As a team we complete activities that build our collaboration skills, strengthen empathy, reinforce active listening, and improve communication. In this conference I met many many strangers that I now call friends. We went through all that whole week. It was very emotional and frustrating, but at the end we stuck together getting through the whole conference feeling accomplished. We cried together, we trust falled from 4 feet, we even climbed a wall twice our height. All these tasks we were always together and raising each other's spirits up. This conference was very important to me because it took me out of my comfort zone and forced me to collaborate with strangers and accomplish things we didn't know we can do.","All of my life I was told to “study hard” and make good grades at school, but knowing my stubborn self I choose not to. Instead I chose to play video games, talk to friends, even twiddle my thumbs; anything but study or do my homework. I was constantly told I was smart, but should try more at school. This just made me angrier. I passed all my classes with mediocre grades mainly “B” and sometimes even a “C’. My parents were highly upset and tried everything to obtain better grades like hire numerous tutors, but I always found a way to get them fired. 
On October 2008 my grandfather passed away and this changed my uncle's life because he promised his dad to become a doctor and do better in school. Later in 2014, my uncle graduated college and noticed me not doing as well in school. He saw me as a younger version of him and started lecturing me why I should do better in school and not make the same mistake as him. This inspired me to do better at school. To this day I follow my uncle's words and give every assignment I am given my best. To overcome this struggle  I joined almost every possible club in my school, became active in extra circulars, and turn in all my assignments. ","I prefer working as part of a team because it produces numerous benefits. Working in a team gives you different perspectives and approaches on ideas. In a team you have multiple brains all working on project. This allow maximizes workflow efficiency as well as quality since you can split the team to pinpoint different areas of the project. Furthermore working in a team allows health risk taking, due to the fact that working with other s spreads the responsibility. Health risk taking is good since it allows crazy ideas to follow that turn out to revolutionary ”outside the box” ideas companies look for. Finally working in a team educates you a great deal since you work with people from all kinds of background bringing in all types of knowledge.

As being an admirer of the late Steve Jobs and what he has done to improve mobile and desktop technology, I believe putting ideas together with other high-achieving men can make a brighter world for the entire nation to see. I have participated in a Hackathon in Philadelphia before, and my app idea was chosen to be pursued and worked on for 3 days to present to companies such as Google and MSNBC. For this program, I wish to expand my knowledge of programming and computer science in general to create a better foundation for myself to share. I am hoping to leave this six week program with an entrepreneurial mindset and great coding skills.","If money was no object for me, I would go to college in Stanford University, and I would study computer science. The reason why I would go to Stanford is because I have always wanted to be out-of-state for my future education. Being out-of-state allows me to start a new me and to show everyone around me just what I am capable of. Also, Steve Jobs spoke there for their 2005 commencement, so I would like to see the minds of people who were inspired by my idol. Obstacles that might prevent me from this dream are the competition, the money, and the hard, rigorous courses that you are required to take at Stanford. Stanford has an acceptance rate of 4.8%, so it is a challenge for people like me to be accepted. also, it has a high tuition, and I do not have that kind of money.","Something that I did last summer was being enlisted as an L.I.T at Camp Ockanickon in Medford, NJ. L.I.T stands for leaders in training, and it was a program where we learned how to become a great leader in today's society while also helping around with the little campers and advisors. The group of us bonded through preparing lunch and cleaning up the dishes, clearing up logs of trees in the camp, challenge courses, and having the children sing songs together. This was very important to me because I myself have never been to a camp setting in the woods like the one I ventured on. ","A time that I struggled with something was in 9th grade, which was last year, in my Modern World History class. I enjoyed the teacher and the material, but I would always do terribly on the tests. I thought it was because I was not fully understanding the material being taught, but it was more of the way I was studying.I talked to my teacher and peers about it, and they both agreed that in order to pass her tests, you have to be able to comprehend the lessons. That means reading the book precisely and taking precise notes. In the end, I was able to go from a B- to an A in her class by the end of the school year.","I prefer working as a team because it is interesting to hear other people's ideas and thought processess.

I have always loved acting. I participated in all the plays in my elementary and middle school. I have not practice since I got into high school and I lacked the resources to take on acting classes or pursue it until I can get paid for it. ","Last summer, I had the privilege to work for the State Senator of New York, Senator Leroy Comrie. I went through a very rigorous process which included 2 interviews before being selected.  This job was very important to me because of the contribution I was able to make in my community. My primary role was to take note of constituents complaints and help them in any capacity. If their requests were above me, I would transfer them to my supervisor. I also had the pleasure of representing the Senator at different events throughout the city, such as Black Live Matters events, centers for the elders, and youth activities that the Senator attended. I was proud to have been selected not many people my age can say they had the opportunity to work for a State Senator.  ","I struggled with various challenges in my life and one challenge that I'm facing at the moment would be studying for the SAT. The test is challenging and maths is not my forte. However, I have been practicing daily and even have some of my classmates help me rigorously in order to improve my score.  My sister always says practice makes perfect, and I realize that she's right. Although I have not mastered the test yet, I've improved tremendously since I started a month ago. I can only hope my persistence will be rewarded.  ","I am a people person, therefore I welcome the notion of working collaboratively. Working as part of a team allows one to expand their horizons, learn from their peers, and forge mentors. Furthermore, it enables the team to accomplish much more than one person could ever do.

I was able to make progress by asking for help from others that took the class before and my teachers too.

I have chosen math and coding. Math was a subject that runs through my family. As a kid, I have been disciplined to stay focus only in math. My main priority is to make my family proud and not waste those hard years my dad spent on me down the drain. I have looked up to my cousin, a young adult making his way in society with no parents supporting him except his grandma. He now works in Google as a database engineer and I'm always happy to talk about him in school. My school does not provide advance math courses so I went out the way to learn them myself on the internet. During the summer, I found myself a website called Khan Academy and I learned a small portion of calculus. Sadly the summer ended and all that free was over. I had to focus in boosting my GPA. During the second month of school, a close friend suggested a website under the name of Code Academy. I had a free period in my schedule and decided to use that time to learn a bit of Python and CSS. I was interested in how the media/gaming industry worked. It was during that time I found this free course. It was really eye opening to see that there are programs that help kids like me into the coding industry. I understand the demand in the US and I want to proceed my dream into coding. ","I would like to set my standards high because I do believe in the American dream. If money were no object. I would get the same educations my cousin had in his years. I would go to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and study Introduction to Electrical Engineering and Computer Science I, Mathematics for Computer Scientists, and Introduction to C/C++. The only obstacle that might prevent me is not being able to provide for my disabled mother. I want her to see me smile everyday. Money can’t buy happiness and never buy happiness.   

",Last summer was very significant to me. I was lost at the beginning not knowing the path ahead of me. I got a call from my cousin telling me he was living in Manhattan. I was surprised because he was my only cousin and blood relative. We used a software called Skype and started to chat with each other. He introduced me to the world of coding and allowed me to expand my knowledge by also introducing me to Code Academy. At this time I was super interested. It was that summer I would come to his apartment every day to learn his past and how he obtain his knowledge. He told me that he started doing it as a hobby for a school gaming team and then it turned into a career. I want to take my cousin’s step. and learn all the obstacles to success and coding. He lit my match.,"It was the 7th grade Science Fair of IS62 and I had the idea in my head for months. I wanted to create a visual Solar system that you could interact with. I wanted to work with another mind set because there are some components I didn't know. Sadly, I ended up with myself which was melancholy. I had the idea but not the knowledge. I ended up researching the components to make my Solar system interactive. I remember looking at my electrical toothbrush and realizing that the motor inside rotates at a 360 degrees going at a slow rate. With the motor inside, I was able to attach it to my foundation of the Solar System and successfully made it rotate. If I had the programming knowledge back then, I would have different motors with different speed rate corresponding to each planets revolution. With a one week period until presenting, I gathered knowledge to make my idea into a reality. For my final presentation I decided to add LED lights inside my spheres. The challenge was that I was afraid I would fail because I didn't have a teammate. I got a blue ribbon and 30 points towards my science grade. The lesson I learned is,  if you don't have a needed partner for a project, all you have to do is work twice as hard, pass your limits and if you want it, go get it.","“Some heades haue taken two headis better then one:

Bias, close minded, naive are all factors that make a task ten times harder. Context matters as well. A team for a school project and a team for work are two completely different things. A team for a school project can be hard at times. There will be a person that will rely on others and believe that they will pass without knowing the consequences. As for a team at work, they will always have to be loyal and reliable. It is their livelihood, their job, their mental state they are risking.

I would love to get, real life experience in companies that we will potentially visit and make connections. I would love to make new friends or future colleagues from this program. This place will allow me to express my true self and learn from others and will be a experience not worth forgetting.","If money was no object, then I would prefer to attend MIT or Stanford. I love to code and craft different gadgets, such as phone cases. By attending these colleges, I believe I would be able to fabricate a device that amplifies solar power for renewable resources. Thus, I see myself majoring in either software engineering or computer science. These majors will equip me with the necessary abilities to succeed in many industries, strengthen my problem solving mindset and amplify my passion to innovate a product that can change the world by innovating different items that makes an individual's life easier. I look forward to working for perhaps Google or Samsung. Obstacles that may prevent me from achieving my dream are the lack of opportunities currently available to me in the tech field that allow me to show these colleges that I am committed. ","Last summer, I did two very important things: I learned how to code and I actively participated in my church’s chapter of Boy Scouts of America: Coptic Scouts. First, learning to code on my own over the summer was an important first step in becoming a good, talented programmer for the future. It also allows me to save money and time when I go to college,  because it permits me to skip past the optional Introduction to Coding class that many colleges offer. I have been reading up on artificial intelligence and when I combine that with coding, I would love to construct an artificial intelligent robot that communicates normally to a human being. In the meantime, let's discuss my involvement in scouts; I have learned various skills, ranging from making a tent with just several logs and a rope, to saving people's lives. These activities were important because they allow me to get ahead in life because a good programmer starts to learn code at a young age. Also, I rather learn how to save someone’s life before I encounter a situation, where my friend or a random individual is dying.","There was a time during robotics when we had no idea what kind of robot we wanted to build. There were too many programmable tasks to choose from and we did not know which ones we wanted our robot to complete. To tackle this problem, three group members including myself, made prototypes and put them to the test to observe which one worked the best. My prototype completed more tasks with less end effectors (parts on the robot that interact with the field). We also recorded the amount of points each robot could gather by completing its respective task. At the end of the day, we decided on my design, which maximised our points. We then modeled our prototype on a program called PTC Creo and consulted our coaches for advice on how to improve our designs. Then, we built our final design and achieved some awards, such as the best PTC Creo design. Although we did not qualify for states, we all learned from the experience and are ready to win next year.","I prefer working with a team. I am able to learn from them through brainstorming sessions and further discussions. I believe healthy debate are good for a team because they allow for the best possible design. Thus, it is better for the designers to take position as leaders because it allows the final product to be the best it possibly can be. It allows me to be entertained as well, and not just work by myself for the whole time. It's faster do a task with multiple people than with one person.

It's been a passion of mine since I was young. If I can advance my skills, it will help me significantly with what career path I can direct myself towards. I would like to be some type of engineer and I believe that All Star Code Summer Intensive would help me greatly in order to reach that goal.","Money is a significant factor in where one shall attend college. If it were no object, I would attempt to study at Stanford University. Stanford University is not only an extremely prestigious school but, Stanford has state of the art Engineering and Architecture programs. If I were to attend, I would like to pursue my dream to become either an Engineer or Architect. Potential obstacles that would deter my path are my GPA, my personality, and how I would make the school community better. Our GPA is important because it describes our intelligence levels. Yet I believe that my GPA is unique due to the fact that I attend a prestigious boarding school. At Woodberry, the classes are extremely hard and are supposed to prepare us to attend great colleges. Therefore while there are students who attend public school and maintain superb GPAs, students at schools like me, are expected to maintain similar GPAs despite the work being harder. Therefore our GPAs are an obstacle due to the work being so hard. Another obstacle is our personalities. Schools such as Stanford expect intelligence, diligence, positivity, and ultimately make the school community better. If one's personality is unique and helps the school be great. This is an obstacle because being unique and having a great personality is not as easy as it sounds due to everyone being different. To conclude, if money were not a factor in where we attend school, I would attend Stanford to become either an Engineer or Architect.","Last summer I went to St.Croix in the U.S Virgin Islands. After a tough freshman year, this trip was a retreat from my struggles. In St.Croix my mother and I got away from everyone and went on a short but sweet vacation. The reason that this affected me so significantly is because it inspired me to do better and that I mean a lot to my mother. She described her expectations for me and I ultimately had to attempt to live up to those expectations. These words re-energized me and I have not only met up with those expectations but exceeded them. We relaxed at the hotel, went to eat at restaurants, and just took a retreat. Ultimately this re-energized me and made me not only a better student but a better person.","My Freshman year was an ultimate struggle. I took Geometry, Physics, English, Spanish, Stories and Histories, and Wind Ensemble. The whole year was a struggle but if I were to pick something particular, it would be Physics. In Physics we were expected to memorize facts, take daily quizzes, write a paragraph explaining why something is correct or not because of this or that fact, and much more. Despite what we did, it was a hard class, especially for me because I wasn't prepared to be hard working. Despite not trying as hard as I should have, I didn't understand the material. After two tough trimesters of struggle, I decided that I needed to improve my grades. In result, I made a detailed plan stating when I would study, when I would meet my teachers, when I would do work, and when I would get to relax. This extremely detailed plan helped me to succeed not only in Physics but in all of my classes. I would meet with my teacher every day to go over my problem set just to make sure my answers were correct. I went through this deep struggle but, I overcame and I have been positively influenced to be better.","Honestly, it depends on the situation. To work independently has its perks because it doesn't require as much organization, one can focus more intensively, and do what they think is right rather than what someone else may think is correct. Yet working in a group also has its pros because one hears everyone's opinion and their opinion can potentially be more correct than your own. Also, it improves communication skills and connections between the members of each group. In terms of what I prefer, I would rather work in a group than working individually. I prefer this because it takes a lot of the workload taken off of myself and it gets more things done. Yet what I prefer is not what is better for me. I probably work better by myself because I am not always social and I feel that I may be wrong too many times to contribute as much as I can potentially. Working solo also helps one to learn more than when one is in a group. Yet I definitely prefer being in a group rather than working by myself.",3/10/2017 1:07pm,3/20/2017 11:59pm,Yes,,2,2,1,909+133+123,,5,Yes,,2017 All Star,4,10th grade,African American,,elijah_atwell@woodberry.org,Woodberry Forest School,Yahoo,Yes,Yes,4/16/2017,Private,Jersey City,Yes,Avril,(973) 449-8311,Atwell,Yes

","If money were no object, I would love to enroll at the University of Southern California to study Choral Music and Software Engineering. I love video games and always wished that there were more classes that I could have taken to help me get there. I realized that if my school does not provide them, than I simply have to go out and get them. I participate in PMEA Chorus Festivals and created an account on Code Academy and Khan Academy. I am accomplishing my dreams in whatever way I can. The only obstacle that would prevent me is my own mind. Self doubt may pull me back, but I know my mindset is strong enough to overcome it.

","I worked at Harmony Daycare in Irvington, New Jersey for several weeks gaining experience in the childcare industry. It was originally just meant to be a simple means to make money, but it turned out to be much more than that. It introduced me to the cruel and harsh reality of business, but also showed that early childcare service is imperative to a child's upbringing. I had to wake up before 7 and clock in around 8  to pull weeds in the garden, organize the inventory full of pull-ups and baby wipes, and assist the chief with cooking meals for every class. It was a tiring affair that was Monday through Friday, but I learned more life lessons from the staff than any job previously. They taught me how to be professional in a very harsh working environment. It was all about the children no matter what the any worker or manager said. I learned that money was not everything. It was uplifting to see the children that you tended to behave in manner that reflected the lessons that you instilled within them. ","I struggled with the Science and Mathematics courses in my first two years of high school. It was frustrating and disheartening because they were previously my best subject. There came a point in time where I simply gave up on myself. I just labelled it as the science and math courses of my school were not my forte. I placed this ceiling on my own ability subconsciously. My teachers were not much help either in persuading me to do better because it all started and began with me. I had to take the initiative and change my philosophy on how I approached those courses. Math and Science courses were not evil beings trying to fail me and my teachers were not out to get me. All I needed to do was put more time into it. Weekdays were not enough for me to fully comprehend the subject. I practiced, and watched videos on the topics that the were covered in class on YouTube. My mindset had to be stronger, and I knew for a fact that one single bad grade did not define. I would rather put my tears and my frustration to attain that ""A+"" then be content with receiving a ""C"". There were no motivational speeches or talks, it was just me grabbing hold of the reins of my life. I was the driver and I controlled where I wanted to go. ","I prefer working as a team. When you work alone, you really only see your side of a problem or situation, however, a team can attack a problem from several different angles. Teams accomplish more than an individual. It is fun working in a team, collaborating with different types of people. Whenever I work in a team, I learn new skills. Everyone does not think exactly alike so working with different types of people can be frustrating but informative.

I really want an opportunity to attend a great college but not sure my parents can afford the colleges i want to attend.,"I would love to attend college at Stanford University in California to study in their computer science program. Stanford has a list of great alumni such as Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Reed Hastings and many other world renowned innovators that were all enrolled in Stanford’s Computer Science program. The creation of Google and Netflix are few innovations that came from these Stanford alumni. I would love to be added to that list of notable Stanford alumni. My journey toward this goal began when I was selected by the admissions team to study Computer Science at Bergen County Technical High School in Teterboro New Jersey. This school is nationally recognized and has received numerous awards.  Learning code at this institute, complemented with programs like All Star Code will assure me the knowledge that I need to know in preparation for applying to Stanford University and other colleges.

Finances is the  main obstacle  that will stop me from going to my dream college.  Two of my older siblings chose to attend their dream colleges and are sadly dealing with a lot of student loan debt.  I don’t want to choose that path.  My parents have three more children including myself to send to college in the next 5 years. 
I hope attending programs like All Star Code will help me get admitted to some great computer science program for college and receive scholarships as well.","Last summer I traveled across country via Amtrak with my parents and two siblings. We traveled to Los Angeles to see my cousin compete as a gymnast in the World Games of the Special Olympics.  We had thirty day rail passes which allowed us to stop in various cities for extended periods and we choose:  Chicago, Oakland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, New Orleans and Atlanta. We stayed at least four days in each place and it was amazing.  I loved the entire trip but California was my favorite and that is when I made up my mind to attend Stanford. I love San Francisco and the Bay area and was impressed with the cultural life.. This trip was important because It allowed us to bond as a family.  The train had no wifi, so we read, played scrabble, cards and spent a lot of time talking to one another.  My mom organized the trip and we met forty other family members (who flew to LA) and spent a week with them in Los Angeles. Some of our family stayed in Malibu and I loved that.  I know I have to make a significant income to live the life I want to live.  We visited many museums and attended cultural events and got to see the living conditions of Black and Latino folks in each city. I learned the importance of networking because my mom had former coworkers or colleagues that now lived in these cities and let us stay in their homes, took us on tours, out to eat and invited us back to visit. Now I understand the power of networking and staying in contact with good people.

Another great opportunity I had last summer was to get accepted into the financial literacy course at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). There I had the opportunity to participate with different high school students in the field of financial literacy.  It was a three week intensive program that provided a hands-on introduction to financial management and investment for high school students. I learned about the different aspects of business and how to manage assets and money. I discovered the importance of team building, being a leader and creation of a business plan. My specific area was to create a business plan that explained why now was the perfect time to invest in Nike Inc. The outcome of the program was phenomenal for me, I was chosen as the top student of the program and was rewarded with an iPad Air 2 for my performance throughout the entirety of  the camp. Also, I was interviewed by the campus newspaper and the article can be found at this link: http://www.njit.edu/features/sceneandheard/finance-2016.php.","I am well coordinated around many subjects in school. However one subject in particular, Chemistry Honors was challenging during the beginning of my sophomore year. It soon got to the point where my grades were being affected in a negative way. The subject was challenging because I wasn’t understanding the teacher or the material. I spoke first with my parents who advised me to have a conference with the teacher and my Guidance Counselor. After talking to them we decided that the best thing to do was to go to the teacher for extra help. The plan was to meet with the teacher before and after school to clarify anything that I did not understand. Two weeks later the subject became clearer as I saw my quiz and test grades improved from that point on.",Throughout my education I have been involved in many group projects. The things that I like about being on a team are that being on a team affords me the opportunity to highlight my skills in business and coding. A team is a network of people that contribute different ideas to improve the outcome of the task. I prefer working as part of a team because it is a more enjoyable experience to be able to work with others and hear different opinions.

Also, I find it really appealing that this program is in NYC and free since it will be difficult for my family if it wasn't.    ","I am interested in computer science and would most likely pursue this field in college. If money was no object than I would go to the top, best colleges for that field like MIT or Harvard. The obvious reason for going would for the prestige, however the reason why I want to go is not for the prestige but for the difficulty. MIT and Harvard are extremely difficult schools to get into and they also have the most challenging courses. When something is challenging or extremely difficult is when I find that I grow and learn the most. Even if its extremely difficult and I’m not having fun, I believe that it is worth it. I would learn and grow much more when I am the small fish in the big pond than being the big fish in the small pond. Some obstacles that might prevent me from achieving this might be my family situation. My dad and mom are separated and I am on my own for paying for my college tuition due to my mom not having a job and dad not willing to help me.

When practice does start, we would go to Van Cortlandt Park and run from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. I started running Cross Country and Track freshmen year. At first I just tried it out because it seemed interesting but soon realized that running became a part of my life that cannot ever be replaced. Running reduced the stress that I would build up from school and being at home with my parents when they were together. During my second semester of sophomore year, my dad got arrested for domestic violence and if I did run and spent time with the members from the team I think I would have been depressed and unable to cope with everything that’s happening. I have many regrets in my life but one thing for sure that I do not regret ever is join the Cross Country and Track team in my school. Everyone there is like a second family to me.

I kept doing this and now I am decent in German. Also, German word order was difficult to get used to but after practicing writing sentences it became much easier.

This summer intensive could definitely provide me with new experiences, such as establishing new connections and learning about code while allowing me to express my creativity throughout the environment. Furthermore, as a minority, I would love to see people of my kind and other minorities in American engaged in fields like computer programming. I believe that I have the potential to contribute to this summer intensive because of my ability to work well others, listen, and make the most out of what I am given.

","If money were no object, I would love to indulge in a rigorous; yet science or technical based school such as the University of California—Berkeley or Stanford University. Both of these schools have always been at the top of my list for colleges and universities to attend after I graduate high school for a number of reasons. Not only are they prestigious for their science and technical programs, but they also offer several other courses to promote one’s growth beyond the average high school level of education. I would most likely find myself pursuing a computer science, engineering, or economics major for several reasons. As an immigrant and a minority, I hardly ever see any representation of my kind in these specific fields, and I would love to change that if granted the opportunity. In fact, I feel as though this could possibly serve as an obstacle for achieving my dreams because people tend to disregard/underestimate minorities. Anyhow, I realized that many jobs are becoming more computer and science oriented, which is another reason I would love to educate myself in one of these fields and perhaps obtain a job as well. Attending the All Star Code summer intensive could help in expanding my knowledge in computer science/programming or software development, thereby making my dream of receiving a job in this area more feasible.","Going into the summer of 2016 was rather dim and ­­­appeared to be another typical summer vacation for me. When I say “normal,” I literally mean normal as in sitting in the house all day, binge-watching television shows, sleeping in until strange hours of the day, occasionally partying, and doing other activities that would be deemed unproductive. In fact, the first month of my summer vacation consisted of some of these activities up until the last day of June. This is when my summer vacation transformed into something more productive and meaningful. I received my first legitimate job at the fast food restaurant: Subway. Although I did not see myself ever working in the fast food industry because it is not my preference, this job still provided me with new experiences as well as a level of responsibility, which is why I view it as something important to my summer last year. Throughout the next eight weeks of my summer vacation, I felt far more productive with myself compared to previous years. Since I was completely inexperienced and new to the work environment, my boss had me work closing shifts from approximately five o’clock up until nine-thirty or so. I was expected to make sandwiches of all sorts for people while preparing to close up the shop and get everything situated for the next day. At first, this was somewhat burdensome for me because I had to remember all of the different portion sizes and combinations for each sandwich and, more importantly, to do so in a timely manner. Eventually everything started to click for me and I adjusted quickly to this type of fast-paced work environment. By the end of the summer, I was able to save up a little over a thousand dollars, which I used to help pay off some of my school’s tuition. Furthermore, I developed a strong sense of time management, independence, money management, communication skills, and several other valuable skills found within a work experience.","Something that I struggled with in the past was my adjustment from a public school environment to a private boarding school, especially one that is single sex and relatively far from home. Growing up in public school throughout elementary and half way through middle school was more or less easy. I often went through each school year with minimum effort, yet still obtained top notch grades because of how unchallenging public school was for me. Class sizes consisted of twenty-five plus students, teachers seemed to hardly care whether students failed or pass, and there was not much to look forward to during that part of my life. However, all of this changed drastically when I transferred to Church Farm School, a boarding school in Exton, Pennsylvania. The sudden change was difficult for me in a variety of ways. For starters, I finally felt challenged in terms of academics for the first time in my life. The courses I started to enlist myself in were generally harder compared to before. Although I never failed a class or did poorly, I did find myself working twice as hard to maintain those “top notch grades.” Fitting in was also somewhat difficult for me because I felt isolated when trying to engage in the student body at my school. Furthermore, adjusting to life away from home appeared to be challenging because I simply was not accustomed to it. As a result, I often found myself being homesick. Thankfully, I was able to find a small group of friends in my class that made me feel welcomed and accepted at CFS. In a short period of time, I realized that boarding school was not as bad as I thought it would be, and it soon became a home away from home. The brotherhood is very strong at my school, which is what I think helped me overcome these challenges and get use to this new chapter of my life.","In my opinion, I believe my best work is demonstrated through team-oriented assignments for a number of reasons. First and foremost, working in a team allows me to express my sense of creativity for the task at hand while working together with others to get the job done quickly. I feel as though team-orientated projects allow me to communicate effectively with my teammates because everyone, including myself, are working on the same task and sharing our thoughts to each other, which is something I am unable to do when working alone. Another reason that I generally prefer working in a team is because the work environment is usually friendly, enjoyable, and more effective. I am the type of person who likes to motivate and assist others who might be struggling, so working in a team allows me to do so since I am consistently communicating and collaborating with my peers. Working with others simply produces the best possible outcome to an assignment or challenge because there are various minds working on a single task, which contributes to more ideas compared to someone working alone. Each person may be able to provide a unique skill set to the overall task or something new, which increases productivity and allows us to take advantage of our time. Overall, working as a unit also helps me learn from others to increase my own skills going forward and most importantly, I also get to socialize with my teammates and build connections.",3/15/2017 12:48am,3/20/2017 11:59pm,Yes,,2,2,2,115+131+909,,6,Yes,,2017 All Star,4,11th grade,"African American, Caribbean",,achase@gocfs.net,Church Farm School,Bond,Yes,Yes,4/15/2017,Private,Irvington ,No,Vonda,(862) 279-2422,Chase,Yes

I’ve heard that Carnegie Mellon is an excellent college in terms of its technology programs and it’s also not that far away from my home It’s located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and I live in Brooklyn, New York so if I have to visit home for some reason, it’s not a long trip. Furthermore, I’m very interested in technology and love learning how exactly it works. Ever since I was young, I enjoyed playing video games and I’ve always been curious about how exactly video games are made. Iconic characters like Sonic and Mario moving around in a tiny gameboy? I was so eager to know how it’s possible.  Technology is something that continues to advance so I believe that if I know a bunch about how it works, it would make me a much more successful person in the future. An obstacle that would prevent me from achieving this dream would be how my resume looks. My current school (Victory Collegiate High School) doesn’t provide me with enough AP courses that I feel that I would need to make my resume much better and appealing than it is right now. Another obstacle that may prevent me from achieving this dream is my amount of motivation. I as a student sometimes feel too pressured and overwhelmed with the amount of work that I’m given. When that happens, I start to think about my future and how great I want it to be. It makes me feel refreshed. "," Last summer, I spent about six weeks going to Baruch College for a program called SEO (Sponsors for Educational Opportunity). Every day from 8;30 to 4;30, we spent hours learning calculus, new vocabulary, grammar, reading skills and learning more about college. This was a fascinating experience for me as I got to learn more and more during the summer time while other students are spending time at home and forgetting all of the things they learned during their school year. One of the assignments that I remember doing was a Personal Essay. This was one of the most important assignments that we had to do during the summer and I enjoyed writing mine. This assignment allowed me to fully express myself to my peers and make them learn things about me that they may not have known before. It also made me learn things about them and, also, gain some new friends that I can interact with. I feel that it’s always good to have your own circle of people that you trust and can always communicate with. When I wasn’t doing things academically, I played basketball with my friends. Basketball has always been a very fun hobby for me since it allows me to zone out and have fun. When i’m feeling stressed out, basketball can always relieve the stress. Playing it with friends also makes me feel a lot better."," I’ve struggled with something pretty recently. It was about last month when the snowstorm hit New York. The day after, two of my friends and I decided to start shoveling snow in front of houses to get some extra money in our pockets. The first two houses were easy and we all had about $30 in our pockets each. Then we reached the third house. This house had an extremely long driveway, but we knew that we had to shovel it in order to earn our money. I was absolutely exhausted. Constantly picking up 10 pounds of snow and chucking it in another direction isn’t as easy as it sounds. The worst part about it is that the gloves that I wore were extremely thin and was not able to withstand the twenty-degree day. Also, i’m not very strong so it’s not that easy for me to pick up a metal shovel constantly without my arms starting to hurt after a short period of time. Although it was difficult, I had to fight through it since I didn’t want to let my friend’s down and make them do extra work. We all got the same pay so it’s only fair that we basically do the same amount of work. After a long day of shoveling, I was $100 dollars richer. My arms hurt, my back ached, I couldn’t feel my legs, but it felt great knowing that I didn’t give up.
"," I prefer working as part of a team since I believe that teamwork makes the dream work. There are some things that you just can’t do by yourself and it’s great to have others by your side in order to help you. You can also learn things from other people that you wouldn’t have known by yourself. Working as a team allows you to gain chemistry with others and, also, gain friendships, which is always good. From playing basketball, I’ve learned that no matter how good you are, it’s always good to have others by your side. If you don’t have an open shot, your teammate is always there to help you score the basket and win the game. Lebron James couldn’t win the NBA Finals last year if he didn’t have Kyrie Irving by his side. When Kyrie wasn’t there the first time, he lost to Stephen Curry and the Warriors. Not even Michael Jordan could do it by himself. He had Scottie Pippen to help him. With help from his teammates, he was able to win six championships and is now known as the greatest basketball player of all time. To sum it up, when working as a team, you are able to achieve a lot more and you may learn things along the way. Friendships will grow and goals will be reached. Even though I’m able to work solo, I believe that working with others is more beneficial.",3/15/2017 2:04pm,3/20/2017 11:59pm,Yes,,2,2,2,118+909+123,,6,Yes,,2017 All Star,4,11th grade,African American,,rtaylor@victorycollegiate.org,Victory Collegiate High School,MLB,Yes,Yes,4/16/2017,Public,Brooklyn,Yes,Opal,(917) 975-3138,Taylor,Yes

Furthermore, taking Computer Science during my freshman year sparked my interest, and I wish to gain a deeper understanding of the languages that I learned throughout the course of the year. Lastly, I have ideas for my own programs, but I need to better my skills to bring my ideas to life. ","If money were no object, I would study bioengineering at the University of Sheffield, England. In attending a sports analytics class at the University of Delaware during the summer of 2014, I became interested in the merging of technology and human health and performance. Bioengineering provides many employment opportunities in that area. By pursuing this area of study, I will gain multidisciplinary experience in Computer Science, Control Systems, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Cardiovascular Science, Management, Materials Science, and Mathematics. Not only do I want to learn Bioengineering at one of the most prestigious colleges in the field, but I also want to broaden my worldview. Studying abroad will allow me to experience a new culture, increase my independence, understand different values, enhance my ability to function in new environments, and design and market products for a global community. While I love the idea of studying abroad, there might be some challenges; I would have to adjust to a completely new culture and form new relationships and connections. Although overcoming these obstacles may be difficult, I believe the benefits from the experience will be worth it.","Last summer I had an opportunity to work in the construction field with a number of other high school students. We were responsible for replacing the roof and the sidings of a home. I started off with demolition and clean up on the work site. After a few weeks of demolition, I was given the opportunity to learn how to hang shingles and replace roof tiles. Impressed with my hard work and computational skills, my foreman asked me to assist him in quantity surveying and supervising the other high school students. Quantity surveying involved estimating the amount of materials needed to complete different aspects of the job, keeping count of the materials in our inventory, and if necessary, ordering more materials to keep the build on schedule. Through this internship experience, I discovered my leadership style, which is to lead by example and work no less than what I would expect from anyone on my team. In addition, I learned to identify the strengths of individuals on my team and to use those strengths to complete the tasks we were assigned in a timely manner. Most importantly, I found a new appreciation for working and earning an income, because that was the hardest work I ever did in my life. ","A time when I struggled with something was when I began my own business venture in my junior year. During the middle of the year, I began to notice the increasing popularity of the Fidget Spinner. After observing the gadget, I came to the realization that I had the capability to mass produce Fidget Spinners by buying the skate board bearings and 3D printing the plastic bodies that surrounded the bearings. The first problem I ran into was learning how to use the 3D printer. Over the weekend, my dad taught be how to operate the 3D printer and optimize the amount of infill, which impacts the strength of the spinners while minimizing the time to print each unit. After learning how to operate the 3D printer, I had to come up with a pricing model and product differentiator. I determined that the cost to manufacture each unit was $2.50, so I set my retail price at $10. Amazon was selling spinners for around $14 for two day shipping, and kids in my school were selling them for $15. By selling for a lower price with next day delivery, I was able to capture the market and squeeze out the competition in my school. My additional differentiator was custom color combinations. Custom color combinations allowed me to perform “just in time manufacturing” and manage my inventory costs. Doing quantity surveying during my summer internship helped provide me with the necessary knowledge and skills to successfully manage my inventory. The next challenge was determining how to get as much market share as possible in a short period of time, understanding that this fad was a short term attraction. To solve this problem, I came up with a wholesale and a commission structure. I reduced the price per unit for wholesale orders of ten or more, and I offered commission to kids who sold the units to their friends. During this venture, I was responsible for maintaining and repairing the printer, buying bearings, and ordering PLA. After subtracting a modest salary for cost and labor, I made a 500% profit on my initial investment.","There are certain situations where I prefer working solo and others where I prefer working as a team. I believe it is imperative to work as a team when generating innovative ideas on how to approach a situation or create a solution that needs to appeal to diverse groups of people. By working as a group, more ideas are created, which ultimately leads to a better product, process, or solution. When it comes to accomplishing a specific task, working individually can be more productive than working in a group. Assigning each individual to an area where they excel tends to be more efficient. When managing the high school students at the construction internship, our group was most effective when everyone worked in their areas of expertise, whether it was demolition, hanging shingles, replacing roof tiles, or installing side boards. Progress only seemed to slow down when people weren’t strong at or comfortable with the tasks they were assigned. From these experiences, I have concluded that working as a team is most effective when generating ideas and developing a plan, while working individually serves best when accomplishing a specific task.

Climate change is a pressing issue, and I am passionate about making advancements in climate change at a social and physical level. Specifically, I would like to make advancements in electric cars and make a program to make solar panels cheaper and more efficient. I have ideas that can help fight global warming, but do not currently have the experience in coding to implement them. At the All Star Code Summer Camp I hope to gain the expertise to make strides against issues that mean a lot to me, to turn my ideas into something tangible.
       Another major reason behind me wanting to join the All Star Code Summer Intensive comes from the volunteer work I do each Saturday. Each week, I tutor recently settled Syrian refugees granted amnesty in a town near mine. Many of the children I tutor have missed more than four years of schooling when fleeing a war-torn country. I have been able to aid these individuals adjust to new socioeconomic lifestyle in the United States, and seeing their strides has been immensely rewarding. 
       Primarily, I work on tutoring the families to learn a new language. Although frustrating at times, the improvement that the families have made is inspiring. Their plight to learn a new language inspired me to learn one too. Instead of learning a verbal language, however, I chose to delve into the language of code. Another inspiration to me were my parents and their adjustment to a new life in America. As first generation Palestinian Muslim-American I understand the struggles my parents had to go through to learn a new language, and am inspired by their achievements. 
       There is no question that different methods of communication- whether they be verbal language, sign language, or computer compilers like C++ or Java- help us understand not only about one another but the world around us. If selected to the All Star Code Summer Intensive, I hope not only to learn a new method of communication through code but also use this new found knowledge but also use this new found knowledge in my ability to create solutions to global problems, such as global warming, and inspire those around me working to do the same.","If I could go to any college of my choice I would go to Stanford and double major in nutrition and computer science. I picked Stanford because I love California and Spanish style housing. I also love the perfect year round Palo Alto weather. I am passionate about nutrition and computer science and although the pairing of both is unconventional, I believe I can use what I learned from them throughout my college experience and beyond. An obstacle I may encounter is that my extracurricular may not show a specific interest due to how much they vary. I also fear that my GPA is relatively high, I am unsure about my performance on standardized testing. However if I am chosen for the All Star Coding Intensive I will be able to show my colleges that I am passionate about a variety of topics which shoes my diversity as an individual. I am also prepared to use resources such as Khan Academy to prepare for standardized testing in the coming years.
","One thing I did during last summer was that I worked at my first job. It was not a glamorous job as I was working as a cashier at my towns community pool snack shack. Although I wish I could create an inspiring meaning behind how this experience shaped me, I do not think there was none other than the feeling of independence I gained by making my own money. The independence this job gave me was the first step of becoming a man. Also, the free slurpees did not hurt either.","
One time I struggled with something was during my freshman year I had a tough time earning my varsity spot on my track team. At first, my motive for joining the spring track team was to stay in shape for my main sport basketball. As the season went on I became attached to this newfound sport and in particular the high jump event. When I began high jump I was not close to the other upperclassmen and a varsity spot seemed out of reach. I took this obstacle as a challenge and motivated myself to be able to be a varsity jumper when JV cut date came along. I started going to the weight room and did plyometric exercises. By the end of the season, there was noticeable growth in my event and earned my varsity spot. 
","I prefer to work as a team rather than as an individual. The reason I favor working as a team is because in a team you have others that have back. If someone makes a mistake in a team, the rest of the team will help correct the mistake. Also, no one person is perfect and a team allows everyone to use their strengths. One individual may be complete part of a task better than the rest of his teammates but struggle at other parts of the tasks. Without learning from others one will never grow to his full potential.

I attended a 2 week college tour last summer and one of the schools we visited was Cornell.  I was really impressed by the location, student life, and computer science and engineering school curriculum of the university.  If I had a choice I’d study Computer Science at Cornell for sure.  I can see two obstacles that could prevent me from being accepted to Cornell if I apply.  The first obstacle is the high academic requirements you must meet to be considered.  Their acceptance rate is less than 14 percent and the average SAT score for accepted students is above 1400.  The other obstacle that could present a problem would be the amount of financial aid that I’d receive if I were accepted. Due to the high cost of the University it would be very hard for my parents and I to afford any more than $10.000-$15,000 per year towards my education.","Last summer I attended the DREAM Digital Media Academy at Hampton University as well as a two week college tour. At the Digital Media Academy, I was able to design a website using native HTML and I learned to use many technical software programs such as Adobe Creative Cloud (Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom and Adobe Premier Pro) and video design using Final Cut Pro. At the Academy, we were divided into teams and our end goal was to present a working solution to a problem in today’s society.  In the beginning, I never thought that my team would be able to complete the task of designing an app that would help combat gun violence. Although we didn’t win first place, the experience was valuable because it gave me the confidence necessary to present material in front of our judges. During the ABC 2016 College Tour, I was able to visit all the Ivy league schools along with six other top ranked universities in the northeast. It was an awesome experience that made me want to strive to be admitted to one of the universities.","One huge struggle that I have had in my academic career was my final project for my coding class, last year. I decided to take coding during my sophomore year at Cheshire Academy with no prior experience or idea of what coding was. During the first half of the class, we learned HTML as well as CSS. At first it was difficult to write and organize my own code. Eventually, with lots of practice I began to learn to love coding and take on bigger assignments. However during the second half of the year we stopped learning HTML and began to work with Python. This change took me out of my comfort zone and I began to struggle again. Due to my struggles, I often had to rely on the help of my fellow classmates in order to complete my assignments. This reliance became more evident during our final coding project of a solar system. One particular problem that I faced was trying to incorporate the math equations for each planet's orbit. In order to overcome this problem I chose to ask for extra help from my teacher and peers. This ended up being a great solution because I was able to finish the assignment and earn an A+ in the class.","I definitely prefer to work as a team as opposed to working solo. With a well-rounded team, members are able to build on each other’s ideas and experiences. Also, I personally believe that I am much more successful when I am part of a group.

The world is moving ahead and quickly it is, computer applications is I field I want to become part of because of its versatility. In such a growing industry, opportunity to learn will always be part the job as well. I want to go to New York University because of what it offers in terms of technical majors and location. New York is the quintessential place to explore your horizon, not to mention internships and jobs. Accessibility is something i also took in consideration when choosing a school that would best fit me. At first, i taught the best thing to do was to look for colleges outside my region because i would be outside my comfort zone, but it's not about that. It's about finding an institution where I can confidently say I want to spend the next four years of my life or even six. Yet, there's a ton of obstacles I see myself facing. First, SAT score, big universities like NYU get a lot of applications from all over the world, and staying up to their standardized testing score is not always the easiest thing. Second, enough extracurricular activities or AP Classes to show student diversity and rigorous. Lastly, and most important, financially capable to pay for tuition or any other kind of supplemental payment the school might require.","On the summer of 2016, I was invited to be part of The National Academy of Future Scientist and Technologist. I attended the conference they were holding in Boston, Massachusetts and it was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. Having the chance to meet with the very best in the fields of science and technology, inspired me to push forward with a positive mindset. Their stories resonated with my own experiences and i saw there and then, I could the next Jack Andraka(2012 Intel Science Fair Grand Prize Winner), or Kensen Shi(2012 Siemens Competition in Math, Science & Technology). These young prodigies saw a problem and decided to fix it because they wanted to become contributors to our society in some way. As a result, i started to volunteer at my local middle school’s after school program called: NYJTL; here i taught middle schoolers how to play tennis as an active alternative and how to cook healthier eating choices. Coming from a neighborhood where obesity is a growing issue, i took the initiative to do something about it and volunteer for a greater purpose.","In the beginning of this school year, I started taking AP Calculus and I wasn't too confident about the course work we had to complete as a junior. After all, AP Calculus is a class for seniors, regularly who've taken all their prerequisite courses, like I did. However, I wasn't doing good at all, the work seemed intimidating and I believed that I was just not up to par for the class. With my depleting grade, I owed it myself to seek help, I couldn't let the cookie crumble. After speaking with my teacher, we both formed a study session for after school hours on Tuesdays and Wednesdays for any students who wanted to seek help as I did. Groups were created and collaboration became a successful part of our routine. Students’ scores on test were increasing, including myself, and I became a tutor during the study sessions after school. I learned that the best way of proving yourself that you know something very well, is if you can teach it. Ultimately, I self-advocated for myself the best possible I could have and others benefited that as well; it was the best win-win situation I could have achieved this year.","I tend to prefer working in teams because everyone has their own train of thought, making problem solving within a group achieve a higher success rate.

Not only is MIT renowned for its incredible engineering courses, it is also located within walking distance of Boston. Living in Boston has always been a dream for me because of the rich American history that flows through the streets. As the first generation of my family born in America, I have always been interested in my country’s past and present. My passion for American history is also the reason why I have an interest in computer sciences. 
My generation was born into a technological revolution, an age where computers are more integrated into everyday life than they have ever been. Studying computer sciences opens a realm of infinite opportunities for my future; whether I choose to work for the government, research, or private companies.
The main obstacle in my way is myself. I have always considered my fatal flaw to be procrastination. Like many of my peers, the struggle to start working is often worse than getting the work done. With a world of information and entertainment at our fingertips, it is all too easy to stray into the pitfalls of games and social media. ","Last summer my parents and I visited our family in Portugal. My mother, who emigrated from Brazil, got in touch with our family from Portugal not too long ago. Last summer, we decided to visit them for a few weeks to catch up and meet face-to-face. Growing up, my mother always stressed the importance of family and even today we stay in touch with our extended family outside of America. For me, this trip was important because it gave me the chance to not only experience new and exciting things, but also to reconnect to my roots and experience my culture and heritage first hand.","In my freshman year, my school required that every freshman work on a yearlong project to present at the end of the school year. The project I decided on was to build my own video game. I found out very quickly that programming and coding was much harder than expected. Although I tried many options that involved actual code, with less than a year to learn, design, and submit, I decided to go for an easier but better-built game using RPG-Maker MX. Even with options where coding was simple, drawing and designing custom textures took more resources and more time.","I prefer working as a part of a team because the combined effort allows better work to be done with fewer mistakes. In our world, working as a part of a team is inevitable, because the division of labor allows for each person to do a better job with their section, rather than being spread thin over multiple aspects.

I would like to learn how to code because learning how to create computer software, apps and websites are all benefits of learning coding.  Learning how coding works and coding languages will introduce me to web design and app development and would help me understand the technology we use and shapes our world today.  Most importantly I believe that learning how to code would help me further understand how a computer really works, since we use the Internet, mobile phones, computers and software on a daily basis, it would be incredible to fully understand how these technologies work and relate to coding.  On a career future I also have done some research on the demand for coders around the world, and the pay base, which looks very attractive too.  I found that Google and Facebook employees, for example, are paid a base salary of $125K.  All these reasons seem a good staring point to learn how to code, that’s why I’m interested in participating in the All Star Code Summer Intensive. ","If money where no object I would like to go to college at MIT and study for a Computer Science Degree or Information Technology Security Degree.  Also would consider Bioinformatics or Biomedical Engineering.  

Why? 
Computer Science degrees are the future source of careers and jobs.  When we do business or service people knowledge of information systems is important and necessary.  Engineering programs and computer science majors are a critical part of future industries in robotics, data processing, and other technology careers.

What obstacles might prevent you from achieving that dream?
As for going to MIT the only obstacle I can think of right now is money.  I have a decent grade average and I am on track, taking all the classes in high school that are required to be accepted to MIT, but MIT is very expensive and the money is not there.","Last summer I worked at the SYEP (Summer Youth Employment Program) in NYC. 

What did you do?
SYEP was not the best job in the world, we picked up trash at the beach and it was hot and very sunny. The job did not pay well either but overall it was important to me because I learned to work in a team environment.  I learned that not everyone has the same or positive work ethics as I do.  I learned that although it was not a fancy job, there was value in having a summer job. 

Why was it important to you?  
It was important for me to work during the summer because it reflects well in my college entry resume that I have learned analytical and problem-solving skills, that I have used some communication skills in a work environment, and that I can work as part of a team. ","I have sometimes struggled with time management of my schoolwork. 

What was challenging about it? 
Time managing my school work/homework is challenging because it is time consuming and sometimes I get flustered with the amount of work and I tend to procrastinate on getting stared and then I lose track of time. 
What did you do?  
I worked on this issue by scheduling and organizing my daily calendar to manage all the tasks to be done in a responsible and timely manner.  I organize the deadlines and due dates with a fair time for each project and always leave room for last minute reviews and changes. ","For the most part I work alone, but I prefer working in a group.  

Why?  
I like working in a team because in a team environment ideas/problems can be brought up and bounced of each other until we find solutions. Working in a group can result in amazing ideas, as long as the group stays in focus to resolving the tasks as needed.

17252,Abhishek Ramjit,252,abhishekramjit@ymail.com,Abhishek,Ramjit,New York City,abhishekramjit@scholarsnyc.com,(347) 656-0945,I plan on majoring in computer engineering or computer science in college and thought that all star code would be a good way to get experience relevant to what I want to do,"If money was not something I had to worry about, I would go to MIT and study Computer Engineering to start. After I finish that degree I would study other engineering courses and literature courses. The main reason I would do this is solely for the pursuit of knowledge, given the option I would gladly spend my days learning something new and different at every opportunity, what it is does not matter to me as long as I am learning. Obviously this dream is not one that could really be achieved unless I happened upon a fortune large enough to sustain college education for what would probably be decades of study, realistically my dream is to attend MIT to study Computer engineering so I can go into that field as it is the one that interests me the most. Regarding the more realistic version of my dream, the main thing standing in my way would probably be my past performance as a student and some lingering habits that hinder my work ethic, for the most part I have progressed greatly and done as much as possible to get rid of bad habits and to improve myself. Improving myself has always and will always be a priority in my life.","In the summer of 2016 there were no large projects that I was able to undertake, instead I took the time to improve at various hobbies and personal interest of mine. While not technically a singular thing, taking the time to work at my hobbies was like one large project to me and improving my skills in each of these hobbies was, for me, a big milestone for myself as it represented my branching out as a person. Before that summer, I was generally a one trick pony, or a master of one, I devoted most if not all of my free time to my technology based pursuits such as computer building, programming and video gaming, during that summer I decided to work on my previously under appreciated interests such as basketball, and art. Despite not having access to equipment that would make my improvement in each of these interests much faster, I still took the time out of each day to work at them. In doing so I made sure not to neglect my technology based interests as the whole point of trying to improve my skills in my various interests was to allow me to become a more complete person, and neglecting another side of me would be counter productive. As the summer progressed I had made good progress in all of my interests, technology centric or not, and I feel that I came out of it as a better person as a whole which made taking all the time to put in the work to do so worth it.","In the tenth grade I was unfortunate enough to have been involved in a car accident, and as a result I missed a good amount of time in school. What did work out in my favor was that I missed only three weeks of school as opposed to multiple months, however in a school such as the scholars' academy, three weeks of school is a lot of time, and a lot of content. Upon returning school I found myself behind in all of my classes despite the private tutoring I was fortunate enough to recieve in my absence, I missed entire units worth of work in each of my classes and had to catch up on my own time. My teachers were very considerate and understanding and gave me plenty of leeway to close the gap in content between myself and my classmates, regardless the task at hand was daunting. Knowing I had a lot of content to learn along with the new content I was already learning in school I had to teach myself the new units at home and catch up on missed projects, and homeworks. I took the time out of my day that was previously meant for relaxation to find online resources and teach myself the content I had missed, despite the time and effort I put in the amount of content was very large and it certainly did not help that I had to keep up with the new content as well. Over time I managed to chip away at the missing content and completely caught up in all of my classes and proceeded to do very well on the end of year exams we all took.","Working as a part of a team will always be my choice out of the two, while I would still gladly take the time to work by myself and focus on the work that I am doing, I still feel that being a part of a team is generally a better experience. Working individually does have the benefits of being able to focus on specific aspects that need more work, but working as a group allows for faster progress as a whole and a better experience at whatever the task is at hand. Everyone makes mistakes no matter what they are doing, sometimes those mistakes can go unnoticed when working alone, working in a group would make it more likely that mistakes would be found and fixed. Additionally, working as a part of a team is a unique experience, working with different and unique people makes every team different, and you can always take something new and meaningful out of every team effort. Working as a team also allows for more individualized focus on certain aspects of a project which would allow for a more quality end product. As a whole the prospect of working on something as a team is something that should never be passed up in favor of solo work because each team project is a unique experience while a solo project can be undertaken at any time.",3/17/2017 5:36pm,3/20/2017 11:59pm,Yes,,2,2,2,115+103+135,,6,Yes,,2017 All Star,4,11th grade,West Indian,,abhishekramjit@ymail.com,Scholars' Academy,MLB,No,No,4/20/2017,Public,South Ozone Park,Yes,Vijayantie,(718) 323-0418,Ramjit,Yes

He made it sound fun and interesting. I also have a deep interest in technology and computer codes.,If money was no object then I would want to go to my dreams school Brown. I would want to go to Brown to study computer science. Computers are the future they are innovation at its finest and I want to be at the forefront. The job opportunities are infinite when you enter the sciences because you make the job you want to do. One obstacle that might prevent me from achieving my goal is the competitiveness of the Ivy League. Brown currently has an acceptance rate of 9.3 and wants an average score of a 1490 on the sat. This means they want the best of the best and I will prove that I am what they want. Yet the journey to do so will be a tough and uphill battle.,"Last summer I went to work at a restaurant in Georgia. This was important to me because my mother worked in a restaurant all her life. I was walking a mile in her shoes and it was hard. It was exhausting and draining. I had to work long hours and had to serve the rudest people I've ever met. However, I only had to do it for 2 months, my mother does it every day of her life. This understanding of how hard she has to work for me to get a decent education makes me want to work harder so her effort don't go to waste.",When I was in 8th grade I struggled with math. I was horrible at understanding polynomials and understanding the quadratic formulas. Math in the past had always been my favorite subject and not being able to understand it was frustrating. The thing made it challenging was the fact that most of the other kids in my class did not care and just talked. The idea of being the only one who cares and wanted to understand frightened me. I feared that wanting to understand and caring would make me an outcast. In the end I decided to sort my priorities and got after school tutoring and overcame my struggles in math.,I prefer to work in a group because I believe that when like minded people get together ideas are at its best. People in groups are able to divide and conquer. This not only cuts back time but each member of the group knows something the other one might not. More importantly people who work together in groups usually learn to build lasting social skills as well as friendships.,3/17/2017 6:16pm,3/20/2017 11:59pm,Yes,,1,2,2,909+126+123,,5,Yes,,Dropped out pre-SI,4,11th grade,East Asian,,,Bronx Lab School,,Yes,Yes,,Public,Queens,No,Zheng,(917) 285-5739,Xue,

I would study Digital media because I love the way you could share the experience that u have captured in time and how much you could receive from a single still picture. The only obstacles that I honestly think would stand in my way would be being away from my family because California is on the opposite side of the country and I'm usally not away from them for a long period of time.,Last summer I signed up with something called the tape program in my school where I was taught how to use program such as Photoshop and snap which we use for coding it was important to me because I found it very interesting and entertaining.,Last year around May I started getting into making YouTube videos I would make gaming videos.

Not to mention, I want to see the diverse group of students and what I could learn from them to benefit others and help myself grow as an adolescent. ","Knowing that money is a large contributor towards college, if money did not have a large significance towards the college I would attend, I would plan on attending The Pennsylvania State University. Penn State to me is a distinct college due to its location and how it is inundated with a diverse group of students. After researching more about the college, I acknowledged that it is a competitive college; yet, it is not impossible to get accepted into. Likewise, at this college I would attend this college due to its engineering program and programs in health and human development. As a young adolescent, I have always dreamed of creating change in a certain field of study or nationwide. Resulting into engineer programs, as well as human development would help me understand the distinct environments surrounding me and spread a sense of change. Everyday, technology just expands and a surplus of complex skills and inventions are created to change the society we live in, I would want to participate in these fields in order to create change and help others. However, with dreams and motivations come setbacks that would hinder my motivation of achieving my dream. Personally, adjusting to a new environment and society would be a small setback due to the new ideas and faces I will become exposed to. Furthermore, the geological features will be confusing to understand and maneuver around, but it is not a setback that will permanently stop me from achieving my dream.","Throughout the summer of 2016, I had traveled to the Dominican Republic to visit my ill grandmother and enjoy the views of my origin. While I had traveled for a specific reason, the experience was an eye opener for me. I was distraught about my grandmother's health and how I was inferior to helping her; however, acknowledging the environment and the destruction it has been in was significant to me. It was important to me because it revealed to me that as an individual, I have the potential to have a better living condition, unlike my family who lived in squalor. I realized that I was given opportunities, such as SEO, to create a foundation for my future and I had to take more advantage of the privilege that I was granted. My trip to the Dominican Republic demonstrated to me how it is important to chase for my dreams, instead of letting them come towards me. It was time for me to make a great use of what I was given. After I arrived to New York, I began reading more in order to enhance my reading comprehension and my understanding of poetic writing. For instance, I read The Scarlet Letter which used figurative devices such as symbolism and the discussion of adultery in the puritan community. This novel was important in demonstrating how my comprehension of skills can expand and have no limits. Comparingly, through JavaScript I also learned that my skills in coding/programming have no boundaries and I am bound to grow more as a person.","Algebra 2 and Trigonometry were fields of studies where I struggled to understand the topics and their significance. What was more difficult for me was to accept that it was okay to experience failure at moments. I was so concerned on trying to pass the regents and not experience failure, that I forgot to actually see if I was growing and learning from the subject. Like a new environment, it was hard to adapt to the new concepts and different functions. Unlike algebra 1 and geometry, trigonometry and algebra 2 did not incorporate numbers, but instead there were more symbols and variables. There were constants and coefficients at moments, but it was something I could not get used to. What made me challenge myself and struggle was studying the concepts without a teacher. With the use of old regents and the notes I had taken in class, I had marginalized myself from my group of friends in order to understand word problems to prepare myself for the regents. I was focused on passing, but putting unnecessary events aside and stop procrastinating helped me understand the topics I struggled with. Furthermore, the work was not the reason why it was a struggle for me, but it was how immersed I was in the mathematical field and how I was letting it mess with me mentally and think that I was incapable of understanding what I was writing and what to learn. As time progressed, I was able to get through a set of questions and only getting a maximum of 3 or 4 questions wrong. With the persistence and ambition I had harnessed, I was capable of passing my regents with an 80 or higher and progress to a more rigorous class, AP Calculus.","Learning how to work independently was a challenge I faced. As I grew mentally, I understood that I am a versatile individual and able to work independently or with others. Learning how to work with others exposes me to a diverse group of individuals that could help me learn a few things. Working with others does not only help me learn new concepts, but it enhances my communication skills. This is beneficial in approaching new people and relating to one another. Also, there are some challenges that I had experienced that I could not combat alone. Trying to understand JavaScript was challenging at first, but from the help of my instructor and peers I was able to gain a foundation of intellect on JavaScript to work individually. Likewise, I could work individually to not exclude myself, but have a better concentration on what I have at hand and how to properly articulate my ideas and opinions. Since I know how to work independently as well, it will help me move from environment to environment and work on my studies as a person and demonstrate that my responsibility and commute on the work given is all placed upon myself.",3/19/2017 5:07am,3/20/2017 11:59pm,Yes,,2,2,1,909+123+126,,5,Yes,,2017 All Star,3,11th grade,Hispanic/Latino,,vjimenez14x@gmail.com,Metropolitan Soundview High School,Goldman,Yes,Not Applicable,4/16/2017,Public,Bronx,No,Belkis,(347) 726-6063,Jimenez,

Second, I am willing to represent the many African American and Latinos at my school to prove that everyone can be successful and to make my CS (Computer Science) teacher proud at my individual success.
Third, I am eager to compare my skills with other African American and Latinos that also have experience with coding. If others do not have any experience with coding, I will guide them using my novice Python skills that I learned, to at least give an idea of how to code. 
Finally, I plan to have a major in computer science, a minor in criminal justice and a career in cyber security - that combines both topics. As a start, the All Star Code Summer Intensive will be a start for me and my future which is gradually coming closer for me.","If money were an object, I aspire to attend Colombia University, New York. I aspire to attend Colombia University based on the status of acquiring an Ivy League Education. This would further allow me to bridge the gap among New York and New Jersey under served youths and my intentions to become a role model to this target population in these two states. I know that earning a spot on the All Star Code 2017 Summer Internship Program, will be difficult due to the amount of different that are also obligated to attend this program with the current limit of available spots.  ","Last summer, I volunteered at the Irvington, NJ Library as an assistant to the main librarian within the Children Department. This was important to me because I was able to be a role model to other youths in this under served community. I assisted the librarians to facilitate stacking of books and I mentored children with their summer homework assignments. This opportunity was important to me because I was able to use my prior knowledge to help a younger individual that sought aid due to not being able to fully understand curriculum within the assignments. This was also important to me because due to my effort to help less fortunate individuals, this will eventually spark a ripple effect on others to do similar things in society based on observing my willingness to help others.","A time that I struggled for something was when I attended middle school. This was my first year at North Star Academy and I was not familiar with the homework structure. Each night, I was able to successfully complete my homework assignments; however, each day I would receive homework detention, in which I did not complete my homework to the certain extent that would appease my teacher. This was on going. Later, I found out that that the issue was that my annotations were not adequately completed. I overcame this issue by spending more time at both, home and school tutorials to strengthen my annotation skills. Now, I am competent in this area as a high school junior at NSA (North Star Academy) and also advanced within multiple area and courses as well.  ","I prefer to work as a team. When working as part of a team, each member is able to realize their strengths and weaknesses.

If money were no object I would find a college that offers game design because it combines my two favorite things in life, video games and art. I love to play video games, even if it’s a game that I’m not particularly good at. Art is one of my passions and I have been drawing for as long as I can remember. I enjoy drawing because it helps me visualize the things around me and is one of the ways I can relax. I have wanted to study computer science ever since my sister told me everything she did during Girls Who Code. She made her own video game and programed a robot to make it dance. Also computer science will help bridge my love of both art and video games in order to excel in game design. The only obstacle that might prevent me from achieving my goal is that I am not a strong writer and it’s hard for me to write something distinctly and descriptive on paper on my own. ",Over the summer I went to Boy Scout Camp to earn badges towards becoming an eagle scout. Eagle scout is the highest rank you can achieve in boys scouts.

Stanford has one of the most diverse campuses in the world and an impressive student to faculty ratio, which lets me feel comfortable in the environment and have the assistance i need to be successful in the school. The internships and diploma itself can help me find a job after college, which is imperative in this competitive society.

Although i was unable to complete the summer course due to my mom's injury, I thoroughly read the textbook that came with the class and decided to devise ways to make money, and it inspired me to start selling sneakers and other clothing, reselling. I began camping for shoes by myself, then began bringing more people with me to maximize profits. This helped me become more independent and take pressure off my mom when school came around. It also helped me learn the value and circulation of money, and how to invest for the future.","This July, I got kicked out of my second academy team in New York and was devastated. I started soccer at 8 years old and it was basically my life after school. I dedicated many hours into the sport and was not ready to let go, and my main downfall was my recent introduction to techniques i was unfamiliar with. This put me at a disadvantage and was one of my main causes of failure in teams. To cope with this I wanted to make sure no other person would have to deal with it once they reach the top level of soccer so I began to coach kids. This lets me help them develop valuable knowledge and skills so that they will become successful in the future. This also opened me to other sports such as swimming and lacrosse that I enjoy a lot now.","Although it is difficult to choose a preference, I prefer to work solo because I would like to liable for my work only and not that of others.

This has damaged my ability to work as a team but if I have to, i will make sure my partner(s) get their part done well.",3/19/2017 10:40pm,3/20/2017 11:59pm,Yes,,2,1,2,132+909+123,,5,Yes,,2017 All Star,4,11th grade,Hispanic/Latino,,kevinl351323@gmail.com,A.

It would also be fantastic to have the chance to interact with a variety of companies and see the work that coders produce. While I am interested in Computer Science, as someone who comes from a family with few financial resources and goes to a school that doesn't really offer much CS in its curriculum, I have few opportunities to truly gain hands-on experience in coding. Additionally, All Star Code is attractive due to the potential for me to join a community of coders of similar background (for instance, as someone who is Malaysian, I haven't met many coders who are of SE Asian background). Overall, All Star Code is an exciting opportunity, and not only will it be great for me to develop a wonderful set of skills, but it would mean so much to me to be part of a community of coders.","If money were no object, the college I would go to is Princeton University (other colleges include Williams College and Cooper Union). Last month, through the YMCA chapter in my school, I had the opportunity to tour Princeton University. I fell in love with the school then, and even more so after doing a bit more research. Princeton University is attractive not only because of its architectural design program (also has strong arts and music programs) but also because of its strengths in a large number of other fields (economics, math, the sciences). Students have access to a ton of resources, and are even welcomed to the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. It is a university known to focus heavily on its undergraduates, which is crucial to me since I hope to further develop as a student. As a world renown university, Princeton attracts a wide variety of experts and world leaders (such as the Dalai Lama, Cornel West, Toni Morrison, and Paul Krugman), some who even teach introductory classes and serve as mentors. Additionally, I was extremely impressed by the sense of community within the college (I remember it mentioned that the attendance rate for reunions was extremely high), as well as the sense of giving back to the surrounding community. 
As mentioned, something I might study is architectural design, since I am interested in the arts/design and interested in “creating” something with my own hands. However, I’d like to test the waters a bit and stay open-minded, spending perhaps my first year at college exploring and taking classes in various fields. My high school offers only a limited number of courses, and therefore classes regarding art history, economics, or machine learning for example are quite foreign to me. Perhaps I might be particularly inspired after taking classes in philosophy, sociology, or mechanical engineering.
There are several obstacles that might prevent me from achieving my dream of attending Princeton. Some of these obstacles might be lack of money to attend the school (depends on financial aid), current family situation (in which I am always on notice in case I have to play a more supportive role), maintaining a good enough GPA in high school (Princeton and many of the schools I am interested in are highly competitive), and currently finding a balance between completing assignments for school and participating in extracurricular activities. While it would be an absolutely privilege and honor to go to Princeton for my undergraduate studies and interact with students from all over the world, I know it is an extremely difficult school to get into. I also know that while Princeton is a top choice for me, there are many other fantastic colleges I could attend and be satisfied. I believe education is a key to a bright future, and am working hard so that I could potentially attend a top college. ","I really enjoy my summers, since often I get the chance to take on new activities and learn about things outside the mandated school curriculum. For instance, for two summers in a row now, I have participated in the Teen Reviewers and Critics (TRaC) program, a program that exposes me to the diverse world of art in NYC (museums, art exhibits, theater, musical groups, etc), while helping me hone my skills as a reviewer (through teaching me how to better accept, give, and learn from criticism). And while the TRaC experience was fantastic for allowing me to voice my opinion, bring attention to the works of others, meet new peers, and be part of a community, something else that I did last summer stands out to me as perhaps even more important. 
Last summer, I also had the opportunity to volunteer at a non-profit organization called the Zigen Fund. The Zigen Fund raises money through a variety of activities to help send the children of impoverished migrant workers in China to school. While the money raised often goes to offsetting the costs of tuition, school fees, and supplies, it is also occasionally used for leadership training, to build community centers, and to promote energy efficient technologies. As a volunteer for the Zigen Fund in the NYC office, I had a number of responsibilities such as general administrative tasks and outreach. I helped reach out to a number of people for donations or to ensure their participation in our yearly winter fundraising dinner. My main focus centered on creating material to distribute to raise awareness about the organization and its mission. Some of the things I did include updating the existing brochure and writing up a new FAQ. 
	Volunteering for the Zigen Fund was an extremely important experience for me. It was a fantastic learning opportunity (had many chances to hone my communication and organization skills), and allowed me to interact with people from different walks of life. Initially, it was a bit scary to be trusted with so many responsibilities. Over time, however, I began to lower my walls, realizing that I was surrounded by people who wanted me to succeed, and that allowed me to be more comfortable accepting feedback. Volunteering at the Zigen Fund was also really important to me since I felt like I learned a lot more about myself and my background (I have at least one grandparent who is from China).","In the beginning of the school year during 10th grade, I struggled a bit in Geometry. The subject seemed foreign to me with its heavy use of shapes and angles, and the manipulation of certain variables. I’ve generally excelled in the humanities and social sciences, and done well in math and sciences, but for some reason Geometry did not click from the very start like other subjects. Despite getting decent grades, not only did I want to increase my grade but I also feared that eventually I could get lost or fall behind if I did not understand well enough the basics in geometry.
	To better understand geometry, I first decided to join the math club at my school and to seek the help of my geometry teacher for extra guidance (he also happened to run the club). Joining math club turned out to be a fantastic idea since I was able to get through many tough problems by working with some of my classmates who also participated in the club. Additionally, there were several students in math club who already took geometry and were very willing to serve as tutors. When I couldn’t make it to math club due to other commitments, I learned to supplement my studies with other resources such as websites off the internet.
	Geometry was initially difficult for me, but I learned that with creativity, hard work, and a willingness to seek help and ask questions, I could do well and persevere. Geometry was a very new subject for me then just as computer science would be a very new subject for me now. Having never coded before, I admit that I am a bit nervous about entering a program like All Star Code, but at the same time I am thrilled by the opportunity. I believe that learning how to code opens a whole new world for me, with the potential of me realizing that I absolutely enjoy coding. There will always be new things to learn in life, and while many subjects could be challenging, that shouldn’t persuade a person to quit. ","While both working solo or as part of a team can be enjoyable experiences, I prefer working as part of a team. One of the biggest reasons why is due to the ability to crowdsource ideas and incorporate various perspectives. Different people have different experiences, and the exposure of different points of views can produce valuable new insights that can ultimately lead to a stronger outcome. Additionally, working on a team allows for work to be delegated (allows for solo work too), which allows for more depth and focus on individual components. In a team, people can use their uniqueness and their strengths to contribute to the project. While I may be good in one area, someone else could compliment my skill set to better the overall project. 
	My experience with group/team projects have generally been positive. I believe working as part of a team really helps foster relationships that otherwise wouldn’t be developed had everyone always worked alone. Whether a group of students commiserate together or celebrate successes, a bond forms. I get a better sense of what my classmates are like. There are occasionally times when team or group work does not turn out well. For instance, sometimes situations happen, such as a team mate falling sick that leads to some work not getting accomplished. Or tasks are unevenly distributed and some members end up having to do more work than initially expected. I believe some of these instances can be re-evaluated as learning opportunities for students on how to handle situations that might appear outside the classroom. I think in the real world people often end up working as part of a team, even when they have individual assignments.

Also, I want to be ahead of the curve when I begin my computer science courses in college as well.","If I could go to any college, my choice would be MIT. MIT has always been a dream of mine because it’s one of the top schools in the country in the field of computer science. My goal is to study computer science because as a kid, I was always fascinated with how video games, computer software and apps were being developed and how each time a new version came out, it was improved. I love how technology combines artistic aesthetic and science. The two challenges from achieving my dream are that I need to improve on my grade point average to meet MIT’s requirements and to acquire more knowledge in computer science. While my grade point is higher than average, MIT’s acceptance rate averages at 7.9%, which makes it very competitive. I’m currently working on improving my grades and I believe that with programs like All Star Code I am closer to achieving my dream. ","I’ve always loved sports and ran track and cross country at my old school. This summer I really found a love for basketball and was really fortunate to be able to be part of a summer basketball program which helped me improve my skills. This was very important to me since I only started playing basketball a year ago and most kids have been playing since they were younger. I’ve always been very dedicated but I can say this if by far the most dedicated I’ve been to a sport. Even though it was very challenging and I had to keep up with my summer internship as a camp counselor, I happily went to practice and practiced even on weekends. It kept me in peak physical form which improved my overall daily life including my sleeping and eating habits, my mood and how my overall day went.","At the beginning of the school year, I moved from Long Island to the Bronx. I lived in LI pretty much all my life and moving away from everything that I knew and friendships I built since I was 6, was easily one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do. At 15, it was my whole world. Funny enough, when I initially found out I was moving, I was looking forward to it since I was going to live closer to my family and I enjoyed visiting with them, so I thought it was going to be similar. Even though it’s in the same state and only a bridge away, it was very difficult and I had no idea that moving was going to affect me so much. It was very lonely in the beginning going to a school that was so different from my old school and knowing no one. I lost friends that I thought I couldn’t live without. But I can say that I powered through this challenge by taking comfort in my family, my newfound friends and other friends that still kept in touch. Also, I really love how my new school focuses on different cultures. Because of all this, I can finally say I feel at home here, even though LI will always have a place in my heart.","Personally, I feel that I adapt pretty well and depending on the assignment I am comfortable with working solo or as part of a team. But I do prefer working in a team for a multitude of reasons but my number one reason would have to be that you can learn from each other. In a team you can have people with different experiences and skills that can work together to manage the assignment. Someone can teach you their tips and tricks and you can share yours. You also make new friends and increase the size of your network. I remember when we were moving and my family was out of the country, it was just mom and I since I’m the oldest and it was a lot of work but then my mom’s friends came to help and it wasn’t as overwhelming a\s we had so many helping hands.

To solve it, I met with the instructor of the band in which he walked me through forming the scale and afterwards I just practiced playing it over and over again then asking myself ""where can I improve?"", ""what part am I having trouble with?"". Afterwards, I broke the scale down into little bits in high I played a little at a time until I became fluent in the patterns.","I prefer working as a team because it leads to collaboration which causes ideas to sprout sparking a surge in productivity.

","I would love to attend MIT and study computer engineering or computer science. As far as I can remember, I have always loved to take apart things and examine what exactly made it work. I fell in love with this art and I stared in awe as I watched how the gears of a toy racecar moved. However, I used to live in Ecuador with limited resources and I wasn't able to take my obsession to the next level. I felt like a fierce lion in a cage looking for every opportunity to escape, but I was finally relieved from that when I came to the U.S. at the age of 9. I was able to learn about circuit boards, binary code, artificial intelligence, facial recognition, and the list goes on and on. It is so amazing and satisfying to be able to build things and watch it do what I want. MIT would be a great place to keep expanding my knowledge and I think this school fits my needs perfectly.

Coming from a low income family I did not have a lot of opportunities when I came to the U.S. without knowing a single word in English. In my freshmen year I joined SEO, an organization that tries to close the achievement gap by helping low income minority students get to college and graduate. I am always looking to improve and I try to compete against myself in every way. So, last summer I took math and English classes for 5 weeks from 9 AM to 4 PM. Every day I took hour-long classes in vocabulary, writing, reading, and math and I am confident that this was the cause of the 200 point increase in my PSAT score. Those 5 weeks not only helped me drastically improve my reading and writing skills but it also allowed me to connect with the 200 students who attend the program. Having like minded peers with similar goals was an amazing experience and the knowledge I gained from them was invaluable. ","At the age of 9 I came to the U.S. from Ecuador without any knowledge of the English language. I was introduced to a new unknown environment and I was utterly lost. In school I didn’t know what I was doing and whenever I wanted to go the bathroom I remained silent and had to hold until I got home. I was desperate to get out of this horrible situation and nothing was going to happen if I just practiced the mundane routine of going to school and coming back. I decided that the only way that I could integrate myself into my new environment was to conquer my barriers and learn English. Every day  I journeyed the 12 block walk to the library from my home. It was an agonizing 15-minute walk but I knew that it was for my own benefit and it will ultimately pay off.  After the stressful school days my brain hurt and I felt that I couldn’t continue. However, knowing that learning English would open up endless possibilities I fiercely battled the part of me that kept telling me to stop. After 2 years of constant struggle, summer school, and failing grades, I finally became a proficient English speaker and passed the ESL test. Knowing English allowed me to have a new perspective of the world and books became my safe haven from financial struggles. Now, I still went to the library but with a different purpose- to continue my obsession with computers and engineering. ","I prefer working as part of a team. From my experience with the robotics team I can say that working in a team is not just important, but it is a rewarding experience. For the robotics team we had to build a robot by a certain deadline so that we could ultimately compete in the FIRST robotics competition. During build season we worked on the robot everyday for 4 hours, and those four hours we were very productive and for one particular reason- we worked together. In a team everyone has something to contribute, whether it is to write a computer program or just make our day with a joke.  Also, people have different backgrounds and are skilled in different areas, but despite that we all have weaknesses. That is why a team is very important. For example, if someone doesn't know how to do something, another teammate can assist that person, thus we are all puzzle pieces which make up a great team capable of doing anything. In addition, I was able to meet new people whom I was able to connect with. The knowledge I gained from them was invaluable and they can't be attained from anywhere else. I have to say that without teamwork or the help of others, it is very hard to succeed, but I am thankful for my teammates and my family for helping me to be where I am right now.

For starters, Brown is one of only 5 colleges that offer an open curriculum in their school. This means that as a student, you won’t be obligated to take any required courses from the moment you enter Brown until the moment you graduate the university. This type of curriculum especially resonates with me because too many times I see people take courses that they don’t like but are forced to take. In classes like these, you find that those students who are disengaged end up lowering the quality of learning that goes on in the classroom. This is why Brown is ranked one of the happiest institutions to get an education. Brown’s open curriculum allows students to only enroll in classes that they are most passionate about and really become the architects of their own education. It also doesn’t hurt that I like bears which is their mascot. 
If I attend I would likely study Computer Science and Economics. The reason I would study Computer Science is because it not only teaches you how to code but it also teaches you how to think. Although Computer Science may have a steep learning curve, it encourages you to fail as many times as necessary to become a better coder & ultimately a better thinker. With Computer Science, you are constantly reminded that the Computer can only understand what you yourself do which forces students to think more than in other subjects. However, the main reason I want to study Computer Science is because it teaches you not only how to create but also enables you to share your creation with others and this to me, is an extremely powerful tool. The ability to create is what has kept humanity alive for so long and is what has placed us on the top of the food chain. With Computer Science, these powers of creation are amplified to a much larger scale. I see limitless potential as to what computers can do and I wake up everyday excited to see what I myself can do to create something that will make an actual change. I would also like to study Economics for the simple fact that I plan on starting a company and regardless of how good my product is, my company won’t amount to much if I am financially illiterate. While I can have people help tend to the financial side of my business, I still feel an obligation to have a basic understanding of Economics. At the end of the day, the shared goal of every business is to make as much money possible and it is naive of me to think that I can make money without fully understanding how it works. 

I don’t believe that any obstacle would prevent me from achieving my dream because my philosophy is that life works for me not against me. So I see future obstacles as something that will propel to become greater rather than something that will restrict me from being successful. I also don’t find myself really being able to forecast any challenges that may come which is okay because successful people need to be adaptive to whatever may come their way. ","Sophomore year I was accepted into a program called The Opportunity Network which is a 6 year career development program that provides access to career opportunities, professional networks and college preparation. During the summer we had a four week program which basically got all of  students and staff acquainted with each other. We also went on various trips to places like facebook & dropbox. While the opportunities and career exposure was great, what I really enjoyed about the program and about last summer was that I was able to surround myself with great people. The friendships I made last summer were ones that will last me a long time and I am grateful to have met such supportive people. Humans are social creatures and who you meet and surround yourself will either help propel you to success or pull you from it. This was especially true in my case because every day after the program ended I would go home and program or try to learn something new. This is because the people I was with motivated me to be the best version of myself that I could be and that made it easier for me to work towards what I want in life. ","At around October, I got jumped by about twenty people and had to be sent to the hospital for about a week. Since I was in the hospital I wasn’t able to do any schoolwork and as a result of that my grades lowered significantly. When I went back to school I was told by my teachers that regardless of what occurred I still need to make up the work I missed & that I won’t be excused from any assignments. This is when I learned my first lesson from this experience which was that life doesn’t wait for anybody and it’ll keep going whether you’re there or not. I tried to make up the work instead of focusing on the present and in doing so I missed even more work. This created a snowball effect which negatively impacted my grades even more for a few weeks until I eventually was missing 70 assignments and was failing half my classes. When I took a step back and realized the gravity of the situation I became sad and gained a defeated attitude. I went to my guidance counselor to vent because I didn’t know what to do and we ended up having a two conversation which really changed my perspective on what failure is. He explained to me that whether I like it or not we live in a world that is based off of results & that if the missing work was too much that it would be best to accept the loss and walk away. This made sense to me because in hindsight, I realized that I spent too much time trying to fix a past mistake and in doing so I only deepened the hole I was in. Sometimes when we lose it is best to walk away from the loss and not stay focused on it for too long. This holds true for almost every aspect of life and I’m glad that this experience helped me internalize that concept. For example, if you buy a stock at $120 and it drops to $100 it is usually best to sell the stock and move on to a better investment because if you try to hold on to that stock for longer you run the risk of losing even more money. Holding on to losses takes up energy that could be spent trying to recover your original loss in the first place. I also learned that knowing just how weak you are could be used as a strength. A person with a scooter will always win a race against a person with a motorcycle who doesn’t know how to drive a motorcycle. This is important because I often lied to myself saying that I would complete the 70 assignments in a weekend when deep down I knew I wasn’t capable of doing it. When I realized I couldn’t complete the 70 assignments I decided to work smarter and instead I only did about 20 that had a big impact on my grade and moved on to my regular schoolwork. By focusing on the current schoolwork I was able to lower the amount of impact the missing assignments had on my grade and in turn I was able to help fix some of the damage done to my average. ","I enjoy the solidarity that comes with working alone but I am more productive when I work with others. This is because I thrive off of the ideas of others. Whenever I see somebody else that is passionate about something I feel a sense of empowerment and usually use that stimulation as motivation to produce better work. I also feel a sense of security when working in a team because I know that my weaknesses are covered by somebody else’s strengths and I use that sense of security to empower myself to take risks and think outside the box. Another important reason that I prefer to work in a team is simply the fact that we may be good, but none of us is better than all of us. Many may think that power flows from the barrel of a gun but in reality power comes from the unity of people. Working in a team increases the chances of not only me but also those I’m with to make a powerful impact with what we work on.",3/20/2017 2:35pm,3/20/2017 11:59pm,Yes,,2,2,2,120+123+131,"I don't agree with a lot of what he says, but I think ASC would be a good fit.

I began this program since freshmen year of high school, attending classes during the school year and during the summer. Last summer academy was my transition from a sophomore to a junior. It involved me preparing myself for the SAT classes I am attending now and it gave me a chance to start fresh and to try to better myself by prioritizing my responsibilities as a student going into junior year. The importance of that summer was that I prepared myself to meet my mentor. That summer prepared me for the challenges I am facing now this school year and has given me the opportunity to meet an individual who has been guiding me through my junior year. ","In SEO there are many scholars who brilliant and when joining the program I felt a little nervous because I did not feel I would be able to keep up with the academics. I later had the urge of giving up the program. The day I went to quit the program, my program managers or PM talked to me. They asked what was the cause for my decision and I explained to them that I did not feel connected to everyone because of their talents. They later told me that they did not expect to have Einsteins in their program, but that they expected to have scholars who were devoted to pushing themselves to do better in school. I told them that I would stay and later that day I began studying all my notes that I’d taken and I participated more in my classes. I struggled to accept the idea of me being apart of a community of brilliant minds and to get past this, I worked harder and made sure that I would be able to understand what my fellow peers understood.","As an ambivert I enjoy my time being alone, but I enjoy working in teams when it comes to projects. In a team you have a diversity of knowledge and ideas at your disposal. My experience of working teams have never been atrocious because every time I work in a team, I see the team I am in as a whole. In teams I’ve always been a team player and when given the chance have made sure that my voice has been heard and that other’s voices has been heard. In a team one never has to feel that the weight of the project must only fall to them, it is an opportunity to be able to ask others for aid whenever one is in need of it.

At Parsons, I would study game design and computer coding. I would study these courses because one day I would like to create my own game, sell it to SONY and/or Microsoft, then establish a contract to continue building games under them. ","Last summer, I spent my summer trying to learn how to code using Khan Academy. I did not have anyone to teach me how to code so I tried to use it as much as I can. I also spent a good amount time learning how to use different applications like Photoshop since I knew that I would take the Graphic Design in the Fall. It turns out I really enjoy graphic design and discussing game ideas. 


","A time I struggled was academically,  freshman year of high school. The  problem was not that  I did not understand the work, it was because I was not motivated to succeed.  It was not until my sophomore year when I started taking Advance Visual Arts and Graphic Design that I realized  that my future and my dreams were all relying on my success academically. After taking these classes and looking into different programs, I know I have to try harder to graduate with good grades and go to a college with a good game design program.

I had to help other people such as teen, adults, etc learn to use computers. I gained a lot of leadership from working in the program. I had to cooperate with a lot of people during the program. During this program I learned skills such as javascript, etc.This program was important to me because I learned a lot more about computers and also helping people.

Besides the graduation rate, MIT has a strong computer science program so I can study graphic design or computer science. I would like to go to MIT because I’m the type of person that want to go to a great school to improve my skill so I could get the best option in life. Some obstacles that might prevent me from achieving my dream is the workload. I sometimes get overwhelmed with school and I hope that I learn how to prioritize my work and make sure I finish it.

","One thing I did over the summer was start to learn how to program. There is a program on Khan Academy that teaches you how to make images by coding to make a small game. I got taught some part of it before the school year started. This was important to me because this program allowed me to learn how to program a little over the summer. This increased my personal and professional interest in computer science. 
","One time I struggled with something was during this year, my first semester of AP Chemistry. Whenever we took a test, I always got a 2 out of 4 on it. So in order to pass the next test, I spent a total of 3 days studying on Finn Prep. By doing this test prep, I got an 80% on every test I took. I also stay after school to get help from my teacher and classmates. Now, every time I take the test, I feel ready. There was one time though, I scored really high. ","I prefer to work solo than on a team because I find that in most groups, I am the one who has to pick up the work for people who choose not participate. I can work with a group if the group is willing to put in the work and not leave all the work on one person. Also, I like to work alone because I find that I get more work done with me working solo than with a group.

I feel participating in the All Star Code Summer Intensive would not only help me get better at coding but help me work on my presentation skills.,"If money wasn't an object I would go to the University of Michigan to study Computer Science. This summer I visited my aunt in Detroit. As a new Junior, I decided that my father and I should check out UM since there wasn't much else to do without money. We began searching for the school by looking it up on my dad's GPS.  Upon arriving at the school my dad was shocked because he always associated Michigan with Detroit's neighborhoods(rundown). However, UM is like a well-off town. We walked around the school asking students about their experience and eventually we ran into a few of the professors. They introduced us to an admissions officer which prompted an on the spot interview. I can only dream of going to UM but if I got the chance to go I would take it in a heartbeat. However, in the age of competitive schools, I don't feel like I can make the cut. Because of things like the aforementioned money and my decent at best grades,  competitive schools might not even look at me as a viable candidate, despite the overwhelming amount of work I put into the things I do.     ","My trip to Detroit last summer was very important to me. It made me realize how blessed I am to have opportunities to advance in life. Such as the ABC program and people who encourage me to work harder and try my best, like my parents. I came to this realization while staying with my aunt in Detroit. At her house, I met my nephew and niece. When I met them they were curious, sweet kids. But my niece would not show any emotion for a while( I broke through, though). Later that day I found out that their dad was abusing them. My aunt told me that she tried to get custody of them but she was told there was nothing she could do. This pissed me off and it still does. For kids like them, they won't have the same type of encouragement that I have had. Knowing that makes me make the most out of the opportunities I am given. Not doing so would be a waste of an opportunity someone else could have been given. ","This year in my programming class I have had to complete many hard projects. Such as an encryptor, a Tic Tac Toe program where the user plays against a computer, and my favorite Brick Breaker. Every project I have been given has been completed through hard work and grit. But one concept that I’ve always had trouble with, arrays. Arrays are a part of programming basics, any program using lists uses them.   
So, not being able to be able to use them with ease would be a potential hindrance; especially now that I have been introduced to the concept of strings. Learning about arrays and using them in practice were two different things was something I learned quickly, whether it was spotting a triple array in my friend's minesweeper program and being utterly confused or being tasked to store the user's name and not being sure how to apply arrays. However, through the help of my friends and my teacher, I figured out how to properly use them. It took me multiple late nights of analyzing their code and several system errors but I have the skill of using arrays.  
","I prefer working in a group. In a group, different ideas and methods can be shared potentially increasing productivity. Rather than working by yourself where you are limited to your view of the solution. In my programming class, I always work with a friend and in doing so we are able to get more done by helping each other.  However, this only works if every member pulls their own weight. I've been in countless situations where I was stuck doing all the work in the group because no one wanted to work. Other than situations like that I feel working in a group is better than working alone.",3/20/2017 8:24pm,3/20/2017 11:59pm,Yes,,1,2,2,909+123+124,,5,Yes,,2017 All Star,4,11th grade,African American,,joel.mangum13@gmail.com,Glastonbury High School,Cisco,Yes,Yes,4/14/2017,Public,New York,Yes,Victor,(347) 899-7736,Mangum,Yes

I would study something in engineering, computer programming, or game development, although what exactly I am still not sure. I would pursue one or more of these careers because they interest me and I believe I would really enjoy working in one or more of these types of careers. The only thing that might prevent me from achieving this dream would be qualifying and actually getting accepted into the school. However, because money is not an option, I don't have to worry about not being able to pay for the school if I did get accepted. So the hardest part would be getting accepted, and I am confident that I would be accepted. ","Last summer, I built the computer that I am currently using. This was very important to me because it was the first time I actually tried build a computer, and it peaked my interest in pursuing engineering as a career. Also although I had many problems while building my computer, finally seeing the startup screen was the best feeling in the world, and I believe that pursuing this career would give me a similar, if not better, feeling.","I struggled greatly when in my first year of high school. I was so used to middle school work and how easy it was for me that when freshman year came, I was not ready at all for the work. So far, the worst grades, in terms of my Grade Point Average(GPA), I ever received were during my freshman year of high school. I was so disappointed in my GPA that the next year I did much better, even though I was given more work to do. Even this year, my Junior year, I am doing better than I did as a freshman, and I can easily say this year has been the hardest. However the disappointment if felt as a freshman helped do better and be more prepared for the years that came. ","I prefer working as part of a team rather than working solo. I like to work as part of a team because I believe it's faster and leads to less mistakes.

For example I know this website that this application is on is made up of code that took a long time to complete. I have also been playing video games for a large part of my life and I have always wanted to see how much work it actually takes to develop a game to that is up to the caliber like a video game, that I play right now, called Overwatch. I researched that it took about 2 years to develop it and that alone astonishes me because even after it was developed, they continue to update it, which means that it wasn't perfect the first time around. However, I'm still junior and still undecided of what I want to major in, but maybe this program will give me some insight and compel me to major in something that has code at its core like computer science. ","  If money were no object, I would definitely go to Syracuse University. At Syracuse University I would major in computer science and have a minor in architecture and computer gaming. I would major in computer science because I am very interested in how code makes things function. Using numbers and letters to make things like Twitter, YouTube, or Facebook continues to intrigue me. I know that making software will take a lot of time and hard work, but the end product will always be worth it. I would minor in computer gaming because I have grown up with video and computer games. The earliest console I remember playing was the Nintendo 64, on which I played Super Mario 64 and a Donkey Kong game. I never thought about how much it took to make those games as a kid playing them, but now as a teenager, I always think about how much code, time, and ideas it took. I know computer science isn't just about making video games, but I would attribute my interest, in computer science, to video games, which have been a big part of my life. Lastly, I would minor in architecture because growing up in New York City, I see skyscrapers all around me. Architecture intrigues me because of complex designs that we see in buildings today and because of the sheer number of factors that you have to consider when you are designing a building, including weather, wind, the amount of people, how big the building is going to be, and if the building fits into the surroundings. An obstacle that might prevent me from achieving that dream could be inequality because, since I am Hispanic/Latino, I might not get the same chance as a white citizen to obtain a certain job or get into a certain college. ","Last summer, I worked at my school for a summer program called Puente. Puente is basically a “Boot Camp” that takes place for three weeks in the summer to prepare incoming freshmen for their journey at Cristo Rey. I, alongside three rising seniors and one rising sophomore, worked with the teachers and the students to ensure that everything ran as smoothly as possible. During this time, I walked the students to their classes, gave them tours of the school, graded assignments, handed back assignments, made copies of worksheets for class, and acted as a teacher assistant. However, I think my favorite part of this summer job was my interactions with the students outside of the classroom. For example, two students, Michael and Bryan, who are fraternal twins, were so quiet inside the classroom; but once we figured out that we all played video games, they quickly started to open up to me, and we started playing video games after school. This job was so important to me was because I felt like I made the transition of the incoming freshmen a little bit easier since I was able to relate to them on so many topics.","A time that I struggled was when I started going to a music program to play trumpet again. I played trumpet for most of my middle school years, and I was pretty good at it, so much so that I was invited to play in the school band, which was then one of my biggest accomplishments. When I came to Cristo Rey, the school did have a music program, but we didn't have instruments like I did in middle school. This caused me to lose practically all my knowledge on music in general because all we played in music at Cristo Rey was the key board, and the music associated with it was nothing close to the music that I played in middle school. Then towards the end of my sophomore year, my mom asked me if I wanted to play trumpet again for a Mariachi band. As soon as I heard trumpet, I jumped on the opportunity and said yes. Then came my first day at the music program. When I first walked in, I saw a bunch of kids all playing music that I've heard before but had little to no knowledge of. I was offered a trumpet so I could play what I knew, but just as I expected, I wasn't even able to play a single note. I was so embarrassed because everyone was astonished to see a new trumpet player, so everyone was staring at me while I tried to play. That day I stayed for the rest of the class, observing the other kids play to get a sense of what type of music I was going to be playing. I almost didn't go back to the music program because I felt that I was never going to be able to play on the level of the other trumpet players after I spent almost two years of not playing. My mom convinced me to go back, and because I didn't want to say no, I went. I was then shadowed by a little kid named Juan, who was better than me in music because he played the piano, guitar, and was now learning how to play trumpet. From then on, I started to get used to the rhythm of the music that we were playing. In middle school, all I played was jazz, which is completely different from Mariachi music. In addition, I am now one of the main trumpet players for the group because of Juan working with me to improve. Even now, Juan and I continue to play trumpet together because we are always learning new things, since we are both still “new” at playing trumpet. Thanks to Juan and the music program, I have learned that everything takes time and that you are not always going to get the results that you want, but the important thing is that you keep on going to try to improve. 
","Both working in groups and individually have their strengths and weaknesses. When I work solo, I can go at my own pace and do not have to rely on anyone else to do work but myself. On the downside, I have to constantly be on top of myself and make sure that I get my work done on a regular schedule. Despite that, I like working in groups for several reasons. One  reason is because there are more people working on one project. This then means that there are more ideas on how to improve the project that your group is working on.Because someone may come up with an idea or take a different approach on something that you didn’t even think was possible or that you didn't see yourself, you will have even more ideas. All of the group members can build off of each other and come up with something that improves a previously stated idea.

I will not be satisfied until i get a 90 or higher. With a 700/800 on the math portion on the SAT, I will focus on improving my reading skills, so I can get a overall score of 1500, which would be a really good score to apply with to Georgia Tech.

","Throughout my career as a school student I have had difficulties with introducing myself to new people. The thing that scared me the most was what the other students would think of me if I made a mistake or said something they did not agree with. As I got older I realized that it was nonsensical of me to be so concerned with what everyone thought about me. I began to learn that not everybody is going to like me and that is okay because real friends are not made when you pretend to be someone else, they are made when you act like yourself. Now as a high school junior I can say that I have made friends that enjoy being around me for who I am. ","I prefer to work as part of a team. Working as a team allows the work to be done faster because the load is spread out over several people which is unlike working on your own. It also provides more ideas on how to fix a problem.

I felt that the institute was something that really built up my work ethic in general, something that I really care about. 2 3-hour classes and hours of homework per class per night in the middle of the blazing New York summer was something that I could not call pleasant. It was not something that I could waste my energy on, and therefore I put as much energy in as possible to get my best outcome. What was also important about the program was that the class consisted of the subjects that I would take next year (algebra ll/Trigonometry and Chemistry). Understanding that I wanted to be prepared, I felt that it was important for me to set up my priorities during the summer and achieve what I had aimed for; which was in this case to have top honors in the classes, filled with other students who have already taken these courses during the year. Achieving something that you aim for is always a battle, something that I felt was important to learn during this summer program,","One major assignment that I had to do this year was in y AP Human Geography class, and it was to be a long essay and chart on how religion affects the cultural landscape. The prompt itself was not the big problem. It was the way that I knew my teacher analyzed assignments that made it more challenging. I am not someone who simply looks for the grade in a subject, but more about the benefit that I can extract for later use, even if it is small. My teacher has a very critical, analytical, yet wonderful grading style that I wanted to make sure I succeeded on. To get around this, after hours per day of deliberating and then deleting, I began to feel stuck on how to answer it properly. What I did at that point was get aid from my older sisters and classmates. The help was done through simple peer-editing and advice. Although it seems simple enough, for a person who was used to a self-sufficiency scheme, growing up and learning how to ask for proper assistance was something that took me longer to learn and be comfortable with. as everyone has their own private struggles, one may seem easy for one is another man's most difficult challenge. ","I prefer working as part of a team. I used to be ecstatic about working alone during my middle and elementary school years because I had gotten used to the fact that most of the other people in the group would most likely be unwilling to do any work, or if so, at a slower pace than I was. However, in my high school years, I have clearly seen the benefit and wisdom of working in groups as apart to working alone. Going to Bronx Science, I have seen many students who are above and below my level, and when we are grouped, there is a clearly even distribution of effort, even when I or another member don't understand. That team building, which I began to realize will carry me out into college and my workplace needs to be built here. Teamwork has increased me in effort, patience, and understanding.",3/20/2017 10:21pm,3/20/2017 11:59pm,Yes,,1,2,2,119+910+123,This student prioritizes team building and has an interest in STEM. ++,5,Yes,,2017 All Star,4,10th grade,"African American, African",,gninguem@bxscience.edu,Bronx High School of Science,Yahoo,No,Yes,4/18/2017,Public,"Bronx, Ny",Yes,Awa,(914) 663-7199,Camara,Yes

If money were no object, where would you go to college, and what would you study? Why? What obstacles might prevent you from achieving that dream?
	If money wasn't an object, I would like to attend either Yale University, Stanford University or Iowa University. I’m indecisive at the moment b/c Im also interested in football. If I were to attend any of these 3 colleges, I would study Psychology or Computer Science. For the past year, i’ve had a hard time choosing my backup plan, just in case football doesn't workout and I had no idea. My mother told me to think about what I loved to do, and that was being around sports. Until I was put in a psychology class in school. I enjoyed every moment of it, learning new things, hearing stories was great and understandable. I think I might wanna do that. However, then they gave me coding, wooowww!!!!! I didn't really want the class. But first day I walked in we started a JavaScript program called Karel/ SuperKarel, I instantly fell in love. It was fun, intriguing, took up my time. It was a class assignment that I took home with me everyday. Hurried up and finished my homework when I got home, and stood up all night working on the Karel program, my friends and I even made a contest out of it. This reason alone is why I want to make a career out of it, it's truly entertaining. Some obstacles that would prevent me from achieving that dream is the neighborhood and generation we live in that might get me into trouble, but I try my best to stay away.","2. Can you tell us what you did last summer that was very important to you? For example, a job, a project, a hobby, or a trip. What did you do? Why was it important to you?
	Well last summer I was focused on the following football and track season. I was going to practices, working out, getting better anyway I could. I was sort of forced to because I applied to multiple summer jobs, early, and didn't get picked for any, however, my training during last summer was pretty helpful and important. It was important to my because I was able to improve my skills, and get faster and stronger for my teams, they needed me. I didn't want to go through what I went through the previous years, so I had to improve myself and my game. I would’ve rather a job. The reason for that is because I would like to get used to it, try it out, and see how it feels. I would've liked to make money for the, so that I can take some of the pressure off my mother’s hand, while she is already paying for my tuition, my 4 other siblings college tuition, bills, and food. ","3. Can you tell us about a time that you struggled with something? For example, a subject in school, a major assignment, or a personal project. What was challenging about it? What did you do?
	A time that I struggled with something was the time period transitioning from middle school to high school. During that time was when my parents were going through a divorce and my older brother, idle, was leaving for college. I didn't have a male figure in the house to rely on, to inform me what to do, what not to do when I get there. I was struggling with work, how to approach certain things, football, making new friends. I ended up looking up to my head coach and seniors that were on the football team that helped me with the process.","4. Do you prefer working solo or as part of a team? Why?
	I like to work as a part of a team, a well-organized team. Where everyone has their assignments, can work together, proper chemistry, no conflicts. For example, during an art project, where I can take care of the drawing, Susan gets the materials required and Aaron oversees to make sure we are doing our work and present it. Usually in a group, the work is more efficient because everyone is doing one specific part, that all comes together as a whole, like manufacturing different parts of a computer and putting it together. Rather than working alone, doing all the work, where everything isn't at its full potential because you're too busy focused on everything else then one topic/section.

My main goal over the summer was to have fun with my family and get away from the city. While in Pennsylvania, we went to Dorney Amusement Park and even tried the legendary Philly Cheese Steak. It was a great trip because I got to have fun and didn’t have to worry about school work for some time.

I am choosing a career path now and I'm very interested in a technical field.  I feel this program would give me the experience I am so eager to be a part of.  I attend a very small religious based school. We have limited resources when it comes to science and technology classes.  I am not able to compete with my peers who have access to Advanced Placement classes, full science classes with lab hours and computer science classes.

In this program, I learned about water conservation, pollution, and other environmental issues, worked with a team of other high school students on making our own garden, and, best of all, was mentored by one of the professional gardeners of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. GAP was important to me because, as a person who is passionate about technology, I don't go outside as often as I would like to. Very often I sit on my chair and tinker with my computer, attempting to learn code and learn security measures. GAP helped me to get outside and enjoy nature whilst giving me an outstanding educational experience. I learned how to work in a professional and group setting, and also, had the opportunity to increase my gardening skills with the help of a mentor.","One of the most notable challenges I have faced was my fear of not fitting in. when I was younger I thought I had to be like everyone else. I knew I was different, but I never really accepted it. my name is unusual, I am vegan, and I was very tall for my age. I always tried to be the goofball in class and draw attention to myself. I realized that none of my friends outside of my school attended a private school where they did qigong in the morning or where being a vegan was accepted. I convinced my parents to transfer me to another school in the 7th grade. In my time at the new school, I started to realize how different I was. Still I tried to be like everyone else and wanted to fit in. I didn't grasp the fact that I was negating my identity until the end of middle school. A girl in my homeroom left a note on my desk in whish she told me that I would be much cooler if I was myself. After that, I decided to finally accept who I was and realized how different and great I really am. expressing pride in my identity is more productive then trying to fit in.

I can only see one obstacle that might prevent me from achieving this dream and that's how badly I would miss my mom.  Regularly, if i don't see my mom for more than a day I just gain this drive to see her where I just miss her too much so I feel like going to college in California would only allow me to see my mom once a year.

During the summer, one of my older friends who I barely know decided to ask me if I wanted to workout with him every morning and I decided to say yes.  This is where my life changed, and I know everyone might say that this and that changed their lives but legitimately when I say working out with him was a blessing in disguise it really was because previously I was in a state of depression because of the close friends that I lost over the course of that year.  However, all of a sudden thanks to him my mind was off all of that because he had me working out all morning and then would take me to play either basketball or football with him which kept me busy all day. Working out with him was also important to me because it gave me a friend that I now look up to as an older brother for guidance because he is able to give me advice based on his past mistakes and has helped guide me this year.","Growing up, I always struggled with trust and who to trust and who not to. I always saw trust as one of the most valuable things you can place in someone because as in my community I have seen a lot of trust that has been broken leading to violence or grudges. I've seen people back stabbed by the ones closest to them because they gave too much trust and I've seen people enter depression because they trust too little.  As a result, ever since I was a child I became a kid who doesn't trust anyone too much.  To combat this ideology that I grew up with I decided to look for friends that I can put that trust in and I'm proud to say that I've come across about 10 people in my lifetime that I can honestly say I trust with my life.

I am extremely excited about possibly participating in All Star Code.  I have been interested in Computer Science since I was in middle school. During those classes we would have lessons that were focused on web development and then I would follow up with lessons I found online in order help me more with my web development skills. In high school I realized I also had an interest in software development which was offered only in my 9th grade year.  The Computer Science program at my school no longer being offered led to me having to find new programs. I grew increasingly interested in All Star Code as read through the curriculum and noticed that it had a great variety of aspects of computer science in the program. The two that I am most interested in are Video Games and Graphics as well as Apps and API’s.  Apps and API’s stood out because I took a short course on it in 8th grade and I would want to get another opportunity to learn about it.  As a video game enthusiast, I am curious to learn exactly how they are designed and believe the week revolving around gaming and graphics will be a step in better understanding the how . Although I am very passionate about computer science as a whole and want to be exposed to many more parts of computer science that I know my current plan is to pursue a career as a software developer. I know that being a part of All Star Code will get me one step closer to that goal.","If I could chose any college I would choose to got to MIT. I would chose MIT because they have a good program in the STEM and the career I want to pursue in the future. The location of MIT is also great because it is not far from where I live but it is not to close either. I would study computer science and electrical engineering or mechanical engineering. This would set me up for a future job of being a software developer. The challenges that I would face will happen on campus with balancing my social life and my homework. This would be difficult to balance in the beginning because the magnitude of the assignments would change from highschool to college but, over time I will adjust.","Last summer I went to a pre college program at Stevens Institute of Technology. This program allowed me to take college level classes that focused on STEM. This was important because it allowed me to experience the difficulty of college classes which, allowed me to prepare for the future. This program also allowed me to improve my social life. It was difficult to make friends at first but, overtime I was able to make friends with people that I still talk to. I would also work on a group project with lego mindstorms which, also improved my communication skills since we worked on the project for two weeks and taught me how to work in a group efficiently. This program also had kids that were mostly going into their senior year while, I was 13 going into my sophomore year so I had to socialize with a different age group and keep up with them. Overall, this program allowed me to improve my social skills and allowed me to experience college level classes.","
In the beginning of my sophomore year, I would struggle with writing. I had to write AP level essays that I was not used to before so I had to adjust to a new style of writing. At the beginning I continued to struggle because I did not feel comfortable asking for help. My teacher would then encourage me to ask for help and kept on writing feedback on my essays. When I saw that I was not improving I then began to ask more questions in class. My teacher would help me break down the essay and teach me how to improve my writing. This allowed me to improve my writing compared to when I read her notes on a paper. This was able to teach me to advocate for myself whenever I need help.","I prefer to work solo because I feel like I would be able to get more things done. Working in a team means that I would have to depend on others which is something that I am not used to doing. Although I worked in groups in the past, in most no one would do an equal amount of work. This encouraged me to prefer working solo than working in a group. Furthermore, if I am working solo I would be able to complete the assignments at my own pace instead of waiting for others or being rushed by others to complete something. Also, if I am working solo I would be able to ask questions on a topic and then continue to learn that and work instead of depending on someone else to help me with the topic. If it is with people that I am okay with and know then I am willing work in a team or, if I get to know someone and I am ok with them. Other than that I would prefer to work solo.

This issue could be problematic, as I spend time in the hospital and could lose precious hours of class and studying at the college. Though I pray that I do not have to deal with such a problem in the years leading up to my collegiate debut, I can imagine that I would prosper against all odds and succeed in achieving my goals, regardless of what stands in my way","Last summer, I developed a stronger relationship with my younger cousin. My family and I are Haitian. I wasn’t born in Haiti myself, but many of family members born in Haiti are older than me. My younger cousin, Starlie, is an exception to this, being one year younger than me. She has been the subject of occasional neglect from her mother and father, and her mother (my aunt) dropped her off at my cramped apartment in late July for the duration of the summer. Family issues aside, It was important to me to make her feel at home, and teach her things that she might not know. We went to the library several times that August, and I made sure to prepare her for her emergence into high school, one of the most difficult times of one’s life. What made it so important was the fact that I could see, first hand, the positive effect I had on someone close to me. 
","I’ve struggled with being bald when I was younger. Going through my early teenage, puberty filled years (for the sake of pleasantries I will not go into detail), I felt very self-conscious. I would feel insecure about my weight, height, figure, and athletic ability. Above all else, I felt self-conscious about my hair. My hair was a part of me, a defining component of my identity. It wasn’t fancy or anything; all I had was a standard buzz cut. Even so, having that stripped of me as I went through chemotherapy was morally devastating. I struggled to focus in class as a result and became very stressed out at school and at home. I started habitually wearing hats to cover it whenever I had the chance. All of these issues made it challenging for me to overcome my personal hurdle. However, with the support of my friends, teachers, and family, I eventually garnered the strength and self-esteem to feel comfortable with myself in any form. I am relieved to say that my grades, confidence, and social life has improved because of it.","My ego would have me think that I would prefer “riding solo”, but I know that my true self enjoys the benefits of working as part of a team. There are benefits to working solo and as a team, the most valued of the prior being the sense of control over the situation. However, working as a team gives you a distinct advantage, enabling the collection of ideas and creativity from different people. Being able to communicate ideas with others and receive constructive criticism and feedback is not often present within a solo project. A team project also divides the responsibility among its members, likely allotting for less work for each person (as opposed to a solo project) and allowing the members to be creative and diligent with the responsibility they have. All of these reasons are what makes working as a team such a valuable option for me.",3/20/2017 11:32pm,3/20/2017 11:59pm,Yes,1,2,2,2,113+125+108,,7,Yes,,2017 All Star,4,10th grade,Caribbean,,fenov_p@yahoo.com,Academy for Information Technology,Facebook,Yes,Not Applicable,4/23/2017,CTE,Roselle,Yes,Mathilda,(908) 425-5654,Pierre-Louis,Yes

I want to learn and grow professionally by working at this internship as well as pick up a multitude of skills. I want to learn how to ""Code"" so that I can take what I learn and use that to my future. For example putting my skills that I have acquired from the internship and to work in the field of computer science. I also hope to connect with industry professionals so that not only am I able to supplement my knowledge about coding. Also to learn as much possible so I can benefit my self and start to help other around me that are interested in coding. Furthermore to create leaderships skills and communication skills at this program . This program has lots to offer and I aspire to take all these opportunities provided and master the art of ""Coding"".  ","If money wasn’t a concern for me to go to college, I would go to “Cooper Union College” and study computer engineering over there. This college offers multiple prestigious program that would suit my interests, and what I’d like to do in the future. The dream I am trying to pursue for me to is to become a mechanical engineer or master the field of computer science. My ambition is for me create my own computer and my own software to helps other around the word with an affordable price. When I think about it’s a win-win situation for me because I’m doing what I love to do; and not only that I’m helping the people in need so they themselves can achieve a great education. The reason why I have an immense amount of passion for mechanical engineer and computer science is that you are learning something new every single day. Whether its learning how to code, or from learning the basic on how to use a computer, and to expanding my knowledge to the fullest about mechanical engineer and computer science. I fear that certain obstacles will come in my way for me to achieve my dream. For example, I know at one point I know I will not understand everything about mechanical engineer and computer science, but when that happens I have plan for me to overcome that obstacle. I must seek for help with my professor or my colleagues for whatever I am struggling in, so that I can master the problem and make it my strength instead of weakness. Lastly, I fear that I won’t be able to assemble a team of trusted people for me to achieve my dream. When having a team full of trusted people, it makes achieving my dream a lot easier.  ","In the summer of 2016 me and group of my friends started a Non-Profit basketball camp at the one of local middle schools in our neighborhood, that lasted for one week in the summer. This was a project that was just a theory at first between me and my friends back in January of 2016, by the middle of March it became an objective of mine for me to create a Non-Profit basketball camp. The reason being is that I remember around at the age of 11, I attended a basketball camp and it taught me more about than just basketball. The program taught me about responsibility, leadership, and respect. I took these traits I learned and my friends and I created a basketball camp just like that. It was very important for me to do this because I wanted to be a role model to the kids in the neighborhood and teach them about responsibility, leadership, and respect. Also because it helped me grow as mature young adult. In this 7 day camp I learned on how to handle the money that had been donated by multiple parents; not the parents that had their child attend the camp. I learned how to create spreadsheets and keep the whole camp organized so there was no confusion. Most all I hope I was inspiration to the kids at the camp so they themselves can give back to the community sooner or later. ","There was a point in my life where high school became a challenge to me. I severely struggled in chemistry to the point where I was failing. Chemistry is just something I never understood. It was super confusing and a very complex subject, I got frustrated when I couldn’t solve a problem on the first try. Most all no matter how focused I was in class I still didn’t understand the topic. After I saw the failing grade on my report card, I sat down by myself took out a note pad and started to devise a plan. I created a schedule and scarified going to the gym after school so I can get extra help in chemistry with my teacher. I wrote down at the bottom of the note pad that I will achieve 90 in my chemistry class to set it as my goal. I went to afterschool tutoring to another chemistry teacher because if I didn’t understand what my teacher was teaching. I also sat down at least two time a week with a classmate that was a genius in chemistry during my lunch period. Lastly every day for 45 minutes I reviewed my notes and had my older brother quiz me before I went to bed. I was able to prove myself that I can achieve my goal all it took was planning, time, scarifies, and help from others.  ","I prefer working with a team all the time for multiple reasons. If an objective/project was giving to us it would be easier to get every members ideas and thoughts. Then take their ideas and thoughts and combine all them into one powerful theory so you can get the best answer/result possible. Also, when working with a team everyone has their strengths and weakness, each one another can help each other out with weakness to make it stronger. When deadlines need to be met in short amount of time the work can be split up between how many members in the group so it can be done quicker. After wards I can meet with my team so everyone can explain to each other what their role was in the project/objective. Working alone puts a lot stress on me and I have no one to help me if I’m need in help. If an emergency were to happen in life and if I’m working solo I’m will fall behind in my work; but if I work with a team someone can fill in for me that day. Then keep me updated as the day goes by and tell me the next day what I missed out on.  Finally working with a team, you can learn from others so if you have to work individually you can create a plan and be successful.

I've always wanted to go to the West Coast, and I found an escape from the city very pleasing. My parents are getting older so I appreciated the opportunity to create fond memories in a place so beautiful.","At my school, English is a very challenging topic. We have read and dissected some very challenging works of literature such as Beowulf, several Shakespearean plays and even The Bible. After I received my first essay back Freshman year, I was devastated. However, I used that frustrated energy in a positive way and vowed I would never do that poorly on an English assignment again. To this day my system for any work of literature is to read ahead and carefully dissect the text(s.) I also find time to engage my teacher(s) in discussions about challenging aspect(s) of my reading.","I prefer to work in groups because I like to hear others' great ideas. In my opinion everyone is brilliant (in their unique way.) This is why different people specialize in a multitude of professions. Therefore, I may have a great idea (for a particular thing that I hold expertise in), but my partner who is equally brilliant and capable could have an answer to something I struggle with.

I want to study those 4 majors because I love math and science, I’ve began to comprehend coding in computer science, and I’m curious to observe what engineering would be like. Obstacles that might prevent me from achieving that dream would be distance and time. WPI is a bit far from where I live and I’ll want to travel home from time to time during vacation breaks. Time is a major obstacle for me because DPCHS stresses a lot of work on students during their junior and senior year and I feel as though I don't have enough time to complete all of the work given to me, thus I don't feel like I have enough time to pass high school.","Something that I did last summer that was important to me was having a physical trainer to exercise with. This was important to me because my mom lost my working papers last year so I couldn't work. My alternative was to do something proactive during the summer so I exercised a lot.

17364,Sharan Chotrani,364,schotrani@outlook.com,Sharan,Chotrani,New York City,schotrani2@hcstonline.org,(201) 273 - 2108,"Attending a high school where more than 50% of the school, students and teachers included, is composed of minority populations has brought me a unique perspective. It has introduced me to uniquely different mindsets, but it has also demonstrated to me that each mindset has both something to offer and something to learn. It has shown me that teamwork is fun and interesting when it is inclusive and respectful to incorporate everyone’s opinions and ideas. What’s most important, however, is that I know that every student is equally capable of achievement.

 And I believe that I can bring this special perspective to the All Star Code Summer Intensive. I see myself as an encouraging force, one that can promote motivation and foster collaboration among a group of people that are very different from each other. 

But besides being able to offer this much to the program, I think I also have a lot to gain from it. My passion is computer programming, and even though I have experience with it in the classroom, I would like a professional and challenging avenue where I can practice pursuing it. I would benefit from the peers around me that will challenge me to be my best and from the mentors that guide and remind me that I can do whatever I set out to do. 

Diverse environments are comforting to me, but a diverse environment filled with high-achieving, highly motivated students just as passionate about coding as I am is exciting to me.","If money were no object, I would attend Yale University to study in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science interdepartmental program. My reasons for choosing this program of study are threefold.

First, I’ve always harbored an interest in how things work, and so whenever I encounter something new, I take it apart and put it back together again (physically, when that’s feasible, but imaginatively, always). It’s a habit that’s grown with me and pushed me to always get to the core of an object or concept. Exploration is familiar to me, but it always yields exciting and unexpected results, which I thoroughly enjoy.

Secondly, this major will not only allow me to work with computers and other tech on the ""outside,"" but also on the ""inside"" in terms of the software, hardware, design, and functionality. I believe being able to work with both and having this dual skill set is essential to optimizing a product’s performance and reliability because the goal becomes designing the software to best fit the hardware. 

Lastly, I recognize that an integrated major in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering exposes me to many different fields and career opportunities. Possible career paths not only include becoming a hardware or software engineer, but also a security analyst, a consultant at a defense firm, or even an academic researcher.
This is my dream and I am confident in my decision to pursue that dream. I know that I am capable of creating a clear plan that will keep me on course and remind me of what I need to do to get there. And I’m not afraid of the time and effort commitment preparing for college will require. However, I do recognize that certain obstacles might still stand in my way. 

What’s essential to me achieving this dream is overcoming the barrier that is negativity. In order to succeed, I need to think and speak positively and maintain the mindset of an achiever. I also need to adopt the attitude of seeing obstacles as opportunities and setbacks as feedback and a chance for improvement. Additionally, I recognize that I need support and guidance to overcome this negativity. It’s crucial that I surround myself with mentors, teachers, and peers who will be there for me, remind me that I am capable, and cheer me on and celebrate with me as I’m making progress. I see this network of support at All Star Code and I want to belong and contribute to it.","Last summer, I took part in an intensive, six-week Algebra II course at my high school designed to allow ambitious, high-achieving students an opportunity to advance forward one level of math so that they can become eligible to take honors courses during the upcoming academic year.

It was important to me not only because it was a core requirement that I needed to be eligible to enroll in interesting Advanced Placement courses, such as AP Computer Science A and AP Physics 1, during my junior year, but it was also instrumental in demonstrating to me that I was resilient and capable of thriving in a high-pressure environment. ","To me, struggling is about not meeting expectations – others’ as well as my own – and I recognize that I sometimes struggle with finding a balance between efficiency and perfection. 

Most recently, for instance, I encountered this during one of my shifts volunteering at the medical records department at my local hospital. I was given an assignment to verify the expiry dates of nurse practitioner licenses and file them in a cabinet containing the files of more than 500 of the hospital’s employees.

The task was daunting, and the stakes for performing perfectly were high. One misread or misfile could cause hiccups in the emergency room, the pulmonary care ward, or even the pediatric unit and tangibly affect a person’s life! And so I proceeded carefully, double-checking every single move that I was making in order to ensure that there were no mistakes. However, there was a trade-off between the speed I could perform at and the accuracy of my work. And because I was being so meticulous, I was behind schedule and confronted by my supervisor. 

When confronted, I did my best to explain how challenging it was to operate quickly knowing that even a single mistake could be detrimental. I started an open and honest conversation with her, explaining to her my method of approaching the assignment, and asked her to communicate her expectations for it as well. After discussing, we worked together to define an adjusted plan of action for reaching a happy medium.

Ideally, we would have had this conversation before I even started the assignment, so that both her and my expectations could be managed better. But that it an experience that I have learned from, and its lesson regarding open communication is something that I have been incorporating into my life since then.","
I see the merits of working individually, but I also see the merits of working as a part of a team. 

One on hand, I appreciate taking personal responsibility for projects. I believe that working alone in tackling a project allows me to fully dissect the prompt/problem and thoroughly plan out my perspective and approach. I’m able to set my own timeline and work at my own pace.

On the other hand, I find that working in a team helps to keep my motivation and morale high. The processes of brainstorming and forming ideas have a different level of creative energy because there are many people and each person brings their own experiences that shape the lens with which they view, understand, and approach the task. Any obstacles that come in the way instantaneously feel smaller and more surmountable because tasks can be divided. 

However, I see that combining the two approaches can yield unique advantages, which I think are very important for making progress on an assignment or project.",3/20/2017 11:58pm,3/20/2017 11:59pm,Yes,,2,2,2,125+119+128,"This student seems to be highly motivated, intelligent, and wise beyond their years.

It may sound a little peculiar, however, it influenced my decision on what I want to do in the future. I was never really a fan of using computers and other technology but I was always good at it. Throughout my middle school experience my teachers would have problems using their computers, laptops, SmartBoards, and projectors but I would always fix their issues without prior knowledge. Through helping my teachers with their technological issues I earned the Technology Award at my Junior High School graduation (only 4 out of an estimated 480 graduates received this award). I didn't know how significant this award was for me until the last summer. My cousins bought a couple of drones in the last summer and we would record videos using these drones which we would later edit using programs like Final Cut Pro and Adobe Premiere CC. I made a couple of projects using the drone footage and during that summer I gained substantial interest in technology. The past summer gave me an idea of what I want to do in the future and it caused me to want to learn more about technology like how to create apps, how to code, etc. ","A time I struggled with something was when I took a Regents Physics class in school. I couldn't comprehend what I was learning in class and I gave up so many times since I thought I wouldn't be able to do well in that class if I tried to anyways. I noticed that their were some students who were doing very well on the exams and in the class in general but I didn't do anything about it but call them geniuses. A while later I found out that these same people I called geniuses went to tutoring afterschool almost everyday so that they could get a higher grade in the class. I began to go to afterschool tutoring AND even during my lunch period so that I could get a much higher grade. In a matter of weeks, my test grades went up dramatically and I did marvelously in that class the rest of the year. Now I take AP Physics C, a much more complicated class.","I prefer working with a team. In a team, a work can get done much faster and effectively. There may be something I am not good at but another person might be tremendous at it.  For instance, if I have low creativity skills there might be another person on my team that has more creativity skills than any other person on the team so that person can provide the group with great designing ideas.

If I were to go to University of California, Berkeley I would study business and get a better understanding of what exactly I need to do to promote and succeed in my business.  University of California, Berkley is competitive and has a 17% acceptance rate which I means I must be competitive to get in.  That is one obstacle that I need to overcome.  Another obstacle is the SAT score accepted by University of California, Berkley.  According to “student-tutor.com,” as of 2015 UC Berkley required a 2171 score on the old SAT.  I should get a top score on the new SAT to be accepted into University of California, Berkley.  Also, distance is another problem.  I live in Jersey and California is on the west coast.

It was a very difficult summer for me and my family because two of my family members went through difficult medical situations. I spent most of my summer visiting my cousin and mother in the hospital, taking care of my younger sister and helping my family out at home.  Last summer in particular left me matured me because I had to adapt to these difficult changes that my family went through.  My eleven old cousin came from Ghana to undergo a surgery to her right knee.  It was challenging to see her in such pain. Throughout the early part of the summer I visited her at the hospital.  When she was discharged, I had to help her as much as possible with her daily activities such as using the restroom, laying down, getting her meals and other things.  By mid-august when my cousin was showing improvement and began to limp out of bed, my mother had to go to the hospital for a one-day procedure, but it did not go as planned.  After three days of being home my mother almost collapsed.  We called 911. The paramedics and ambulance along with two police dispatchers rushed over to our house.  Mom went back to the hospital to correct her prior surgery.  My mother did not come home until late October.   She remained hospitalized through the rest of the summer.  We spent plenty of time looking after my cousin who was in a wheelchair and visiting mom at the hospital.  It was important for me to stay home with my younger sister some days, help my mother and my cousin because family is my number one priority. Without my family I would not be who I am today.   My summer 2016 experience though unusual, taught me the importance of family and made me more responsible.","When I joined the debate club, I was asked to write a debate paper on the topic, “Should Chinese students be given US visas?”   I was inexperienced so they paired me with a junior student who was more experienced.  She had been given the books we were supposed to use as reference and she promised to send me her written argument so I could use it as a basis for mine. The project was challenging because I had never written such a paper.  My partner was reluctant to write her essay and I was not sure how to go about mine.  I sent emails and texts to my partner but she still did not send her essay.  She has asked me to wait a few days so she could piece her paper together, but soon a few days turned into a week and then the weekend before the deadline arrived.  I asked her again for her paper and she said she could not send it to me because she was not home.  As it was getting late, I decided to take charge and write my own argument. I researched our topic by reading through other databases, watching news segments and listening to arguments as I did not have the book.  I was able to write the paper and present it against the opposition. In the end, I helped my team win and on the tally board I got a higher score than my partner who was a returning member of the River Dell Debate Team.  That experience taught me to take initiative and get things done and not wait for anyone.","I enjoy working solo because I can explore with a lot of my own ideas and try new things out.  Working as a solo gives me the power to do what I want, as I want it and how I want it.

It would also be something good to put on my resume for a job.,"If money wasn't a thing I had to worry about, then I'd probably go to Chatham University. I would most likely study computer science since that is what I'm most interested in. I know Chatham might not be the most prestigious school, but it is the only college that I have a clear understanding of what they offer. This is because they have visited my school and told me the courses they offer. They also told me what courses they are good at, and computer science was one of them. Besides money, the only obstacles that would hold me back are probably the things on my end. Things like my record and my grades would play a big role when applying for the school. There are a different set of obstacles I would face when applying for the career of my choice, though. Things like my level of degree from college and past work experience would probably limit my chances of achieving my career goal. But it can also have the opposite effect. It can greatly boost my chances of achieving my dream career.","Last summer, I decided that I wanted to get a job, so I did. It didn't feel like a job over the course of the summer. I was a C.I.T (counselor in training). It was more of a learning experience than a job. We learned primarily things about HIV and AIDS. The rest of the time, we were talking about jobs and things related to that. That was a very important aspect of my life, in my opinion, because I learned key information that most people don't know. I learned that stereotypes about HIV and AIDS are wrong. Things like drinking from the same cup as someone with HIV will give you HIV, too were cleared up for me and proven wrong. Most people actually believe that it is true which now surprises me now that I have the facts. We also did things like lead the McKeesport AIDS walk. That was really fun. I met some amazing people both with HIV and without. Altogether, I'm glad that I applied for that job. I learned some really interesting things and met some really interesting people. That is why that experience is so important to me.","A time I struggled with something is when I was given a particular assignment for English class. In fact, it was the worst assignment that I could have been given in my opinion. The assignment was that we had to choose from a list of college level books that we had to read and do an essay with a minimum of 3 pages on it. I was so surprised that I was being given such an assignment. In all honesty, I was only upset about it because I am a slow reader and we were being given a deadline for the assignment. I've tried reading at a faster pace, but when I do, I don't really absorb the text. In the end, I did finish the book on time. I had to devote almost every second of time I had to myself to reading the book. I was very proud of myself for it.","I enjoy working with a team ad long as the team puts forth their best efforts. When in a team, I can get outside opinions about things I should do differently to make something better.

I choose Harvard Business School because business is a field I would like to have a career in. An obstacle that may prevent me from achieving my dream would be adjusting to the social environment. I say this would be a problem because it would be a change to my current day to day life experience, for example it's like taking a wild animal from it's natural habitat and putting it in the zoo. Although college is a major advance in someones life, I picture myself not adjusting right away. College can change a students life, personality, and outlook on several things, similar to the wild animal allusion. I plan on building character in the college that I attend, I have an outgoing personality and I am very optimistic of my social life in college without letting it disturb my education.","Summer of 2016 I participated in a tent revival with my church. A tent revival is Christians coming together to take in the preachers teachings, usually lasting 3 days, with church services all day long without the distraction of cell phones and the outside world. Tent revivals are important to me because I connected on a spiritual level that most people have not yet encountered.","One thing that I had to overcome in order to achieve great future health and well being was losing nearly 50 pounds. It took me 3 1/2 months of dedication to prove to myself I was capable of doing something like that. I didn't do it for others, but I did want to prove the doubters wrong. I'm proud of myself for achieving this accomplishment and have hope in others as well. The challenges I faced were not giving up if I didn't see significant changes in a short amount of time and staying consistent.

I've taken classes in computer Science at school, but it only involved creating web sites.","If money were no object then I would most likely attend The New School at NYU. What particularly appeals to me about The New School is the chance to select a specific school within The New School, and then to design my own course of study -- a way of customizing my education in contrast to the “one size fits all” approach found at some other universities. The Culture and Media B.A. program in the Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts has specifically attracted my interest. I would like to learn about digital technology and manipulating data. After taking a computer science course last year I realized then that computing was interesting, but I would need more exposure at a higher level and have a chance to apply that experience by developing skills in coding and other digital disciplines.  The New School’s program would provide me with a wider exposure to working in the tech field and increase my knowledge base in the field. I would anticipate that the program will supply me with both a conceptual understanding and practical skills that will benefit me as I enter the workforce after graduation. 
And with its location in the heart of New York City, The New School offers opportunities for acquiring a computer science and liberal arts education that extend far beyond the classroom. Those opportunities include a wide variety of internships, in government, in private industry and at nonprofit and cultural institutions. Beyond that, there are the city’s world-class museums, its theater and other cultural attractions, and even its diverse restaurants and energetic nightlife. Not to be overlooked is the experience of living and studying in a richly diverse city that draws ambitious and accomplished people from all over the world.","Last summer the most important thing I did was the Thompson Boat center rowing program. Rowing is my major hobby for lack of a better word, it helps to provide me with the structure and the discipline I need in many other parts of my life. There are many times in a day where I’m doing something difficult and I think about all the hard work in crew, then I’m able to push through whatever it was that I thought was difficult at the time. Crew has been instrumental with teaching me to work cooperatively with my teammates. In crew you need everyone to work together to make the boat go fast, thus allowing me to improve my communication and team building skills. ","Most recently my biggest struggle has been the crew team. Despite my hard work, I’m not seeing the success that I thought I would be seeing at this point in the season, and at times it makes me want to give up. However, I know that if I work hard and put my nose to the grindstone eventually my hard work will pay-off. I was in a similar situation last season, but by working hard I was able to prove to myself and to my coaches, that putting in more time and effort improved my standing on the team. I understand the importance of hard work and how everything will not always be handed to you. ","I am a natural team player. When it comes to working cooperatively I believe that my experiences of living in China and Indonesia and having to adjust to cultural norms and attitudes have made me more open-minded, curious, and understanding of cultures and practices that are different from my own. With the broader worldly perspective I’ve gained from my time abroad, I will be prepared to approach my classmates and new surroundings and ideas with an open mind. A classroom can serve as a key setting for this kind of engagement, where I can focus on my studies and express myself actively in class discussions while sharing my personal history and building on that to promote inclusiveness. If I’m in a situation where I know I can depend on my teammates I’m more than willing to work cooperatively on a shared goal.

I worked hard to help Dr. Baxter by creating and organizing survey data, interviewing people about their electronic cigarettes use and helping her organize her classes. This internship was important to me because it gave me a different perspective of nursing as a profession.","One subject that was pretty challenging to me in school was my history class. It was challenging because I wasn’t really as interested in history topics as much as I was math and science. One thing that I did to solve this problem was to constantly meet with my teacher about the material that we learned in class. I would usually meet with him the day before the test, or when I have an essay due for the class. The meetings really helped me to understand the subject matter much better and now I’m more prepared for tests and essays. Now I’m able to see the relevance and connectedness of historical events and I see how important history is. The meetings also helped me to form better relationships with my teachers as well. In conclusion, I realized that meeting with my teacher can help me improve my work and can help me appreciate history too.","I am very independent, but I prefer to work as a team rather than solo. Being on a team has more advantages than just working by myself. First, working as a team allows people to share their thoughts and ideas. Secondly, another advantage of working as part of a team is that people work faster and more efficiently when they have good chemistry together. Team chemistry is one of the most important aspects of working as a team. Good teams are more than just a collection of talented members. Teams combine the efforts and abilities of members in the right way to get stuff done faster and more effective. A lot of careers in STEM involve working with other people. If you can easily communicate and work well with other people, the job of solving problems in STEM will be much easier and more efficient. In conclusion, there are many skills that are essential for success in the STEM field. However, knowing how to work cooperatively with other people as a team is just as important as just knowing math and science concepts.

I would like to study History as an undergraduate, and from there go to law school. Personally, I think Howard is the ideal institution for a student like me. It is close enough for my parents to get to if needed, but far enough away from Pittsburgh to gain different experiences and opportunities. Being that Howard is an HBCU, I would be surrounded by my peers who are trying to achieve similar goals as myself. I am aware, however, that Howard is a very competitive school, and it may be difficult to get in.  
","2)	Last summer, I was able to apply for an receive a job at McDonalds. While the ideal summer for a high school students probably doesn't include making burgers or fries, my job was very important to me because it allowed me to have financial independence for the first time in my life. ","3)	In tenth grade, I struggled with algebra 2. I scored poorly on many tests, and I would often have to do extra credit assignments to offset my test grades. Our teacher taught entire chapters in one day, and the speed of the class was hard for me. In the second half of the school year, I started to get extra help with algebra 2 during my lunch periods, and my test scores improved as a result.
","4)	While I enjoy working in groups because I can bounce ideas off of my peers, I am much more productive and comfortable working independently. I've learned over my school career that if I think about something for enough time, I can find the answer or method that is required without the help of others. Oftentimes other people can be distracting and detract from the overall goal.

Why? Because it would not matter what college u go to just because one college is more expensive doesn't make it better at all. What does make it a good college is the students there the more u try and harder u try and accomplish your dream will make the difference between a good college or a bad one. Some obstacles i would face would most likely be getting accepted to a college because although money would not be a object grades might come in place. ,2.last summer i had my first lesson that made me want to chase this dream. Since my family is poor my mom sent me to live with my dad that left us since i was a baby. My race is mexican so all she really thinks about is education and good grades but i wanna reach a higher goal so as i moved to atlanta Georgia with my dad i got to meet his family. They did not treat me well at all i usually starved and cried while i was over there i had no hope i wanted to come back with my mom but one day i decided to download an app that was called flappy bird it was amazing how such a simple game kept my mind busy maybe people might see it as just a game but i saw it as a way to keep me from the things i was going thru. The lesson i learned was small things can make a huge difference and from that day on i really wanted to make and app that not just helps people in a way but they can enjoy and that is one of many ideas i have. The reason why this is important to me well it pretty much explains itself,3. Most of my life ive been struggling with school life and well mostly everything. Ive been doubted alot in my life and i want to make a difference i wanna make it far enough and get my name known in this world school was always challenging for me because i had to learn english while keeping up with my classmates. I always practiced with my words after school by myself teaching myself from words i hear on the daily. But every little or big problem i have the only way i solve them is thru work right thru them and keep heading forward.,4.

It's hard for me and my friends to search things that we want right away. It's like we go through a maze just to find what we want.,"If money were no object I would go to Morehouse College in Atlanta. My Dad has told me all my life about making sure no matter what I do that I should make a significant impact on the lives of people because that what we were put on earth for. Morehouse is a historic college. Dr. Martin Luther King attended Morehouse. The impact that he's had on society is bar none. 

Which brings me to why being in such a field as Computer Science will give me the opportunity to impact to all lives. We are vastly moving in a direction where technology is heavily influencing what we do in our every day lives from online schooling, to social media all the way to changing the channel on your TV. I believe that being in such a field can lead to ground breaking work and help advance our society as a whole. 

The only obstacle that may prevent me from achieving this dream to impact lives through this field is the financial cost of attending this school. My dad will never admit that we are a struggling family but we are. My family cannot afford to pay for my school. I have been saving since I was 11 years old. I have a long way to go but I am determined to advance my education. I was taught at a young age that hard work pays off! So far what I was taught has been true. ",Last summer I worked with my dad for Homewood Community Sports. He let me shadow him so that I could see what he does on a daily basis. I seen how much of an impact my dad has on kids and parents and I see why he is always working and sacrifices his own because when you see how much people are struggling it makes you feel that you should be complaining about your situation. You should be grateful you have what you have. The bonding that I had with my dad I will never forget. ,Last summer was one of the most difficult times of my life. I had my 3rd knee surgery. I am an athlete and one of my goals was to play basketball for Penn Hills High School. I was not able to play because I kept re-injuring my knee. This was a down time for me. I felt like there was nothing else for me to do but my family always reminded me that playing sports is just a dream that many want to do but what will I do after sports. Even if I made it to the pros what would I do? I would change the world and Technology is key in this goal. I must admit I was depressed. I think me coming out of my depression was the most difficult thing I had to deal with in my entire life. I had to find away to be motivated and not let years of hospital visits and surgeries ruin my fun in life. ,I think I can work by myself and with a team. I seem to do well both ways.

17410,Marcus Stevens,410,marcuskastevens@icloud.com,Marcus,Stevens,Pittsburgh,mstevens19@centralcatholichs.com,(412) 805-4062,"I am currently a sophomore at Central Catholic High School in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  I have spent the last two years as an Investing Now student as well and I have enjoyed learning about STEM disciplines and careers.  I do well in my math and science classes and registered for an honors computer networking class for my junior year, which I am looking forward to.  

Having no scientists in my family, I applied to Investing Now because I wanted to learn more about STEM, learn more about how I can be a part of it someday, what it takes to succeed, and hopefully set on a rigorous path that will help me contribute at the highest level possible to diversity in the field.  What motivated me to be a student in that program and challenge myself at school are the same things that motivate me to apply to All Star Code Summer Intensive.  

There is a saying that a rising tide lifts all boats.  I feel this way about my family and my community.  The more I can and hope to achieve, the more I can be an influence for good to my family and among my peers.  In this regard, I firmly believe that unless and until African Americans and Hispanics are better represented in STEM professions, our boats won't rise, and our communities will continue to stagnate.  We can't accept this, we have to and need to succeed.  I am willing to work hard and hope to do just that.

Finally, my school is an all boys school.  What I have learned in this environment is that boys really do learn - and act - differently.  A program that recognizes the value of male achievement and is just for boys is rare and interests me very much.  I hope you will accept this application and favorably consider me for participation this summer.","If money were no object .... and I were accepted, I would go to Stanford to study math and life sciences.  I would study these subjects because I like finding answers to problems.  I can always count on a math problem to have an exact answer.  Although a bit more work, and sometimes research, the same can be said for life sciences.

I would choose Stanford for its reputation, and the quality of its education.  Also, my mom is from California, and being close to my California family would be a bonus.  

The very real obstacles that could prevent me from achieving this dream are my SAT scores, the hyper-competitive selection process, and, of course, the costs associated with attending that school.","Last summer, I participated in two activities that were, and remain, very important to me.  The first was Investing Now at the University of Pittsburgh's School of Engineering.  That program, with its ongoing classes, labs, and activities has helped me expand my knowledge about STEM disciplines and careers, which is something that I couldn't get anywhere else, and I am grateful to have that opportunity.

The second was a leadership and baseball program at the United States Naval Academy.  I admire those brave people who are willing to be strong, willing to stand up to keep our country safe, and willing to work hard to be the best.  That, coupled with the discipline in learning, fitness and overall mental and physical readiness is inspiring.  I got to experience its mission-driven atmosphere for a week last summer with daily leadership exercises and lectures from decorated service members.  It was an experience I'll never forget, and it helped me realize that you are what you repeatedly do, so success is a habit, not a single act.","I have what I think are typical struggles with keeping up my grades.  The demands of my classes can feel overwhelming at times, especially since my goals are always to be on the high honors roles.  But, what has been one of my hardest struggles so far has happened this school year, and continues even to today.  It's embarrassing to admit, because it's never happened to me before.  I have been benched for almost every game of this year's high school baseball season.  

You have to understand, I am athletic and love tough competition.  I play ice hockey too, and as a defenseman, I get energized when I skate fast, check the other team, and score goals.  The same is true for baseball, which I've played every year since t-ball.  I can run fast in center field and I can be counted on to hit well under pressure.  My favorite time to be up at bat is when the bases are loaded!  But, my coach has not played me much this year at all.  I haven't been in trouble, I do my best to keep a positive attitude, and I don't miss practices, but I have no explanation for it.  I'm trying to learn from it, which is a hard, humbling, and a daily struggle.  I hope that if I keep showing up and showing my dedication, things will change.  Maybe they won't.  I know these are life lessons, and this season might end up being a metaphor for something else later in my life.  But it stinks, and I wrestle with accepting these circumstances every day.  Some days I do better than others.

In the end though, I come back to what's really important.  My family, my grades, my future, and I stay focused on those things that keep me on the right path.","I am happy working alone or as part of a team.  But my preference is as part of a team where everyone pulls equal weight.  Many heads are better, and more creative, than one.  It also can turn work into lots of fun.  I also enjoy the social aspect of working as a team, especially when there is competition with another team, or a goal that everyone is trying to achieve.",4/28/2017 10:57pm,4/28/2017 11:59pm,Yes,,2,1,2,133+125+123,"kind of machismo, may be someone to watch in our efforts to avoid toxic masculinity in our all-male classrooms. but he literally said ""a rising tide lifts all boats"" which is one of our weekly themes.",5,Yes,,2017 All Star,4,10th grade,"African American, Hispanic/Latino",,marcuskastevens@icloud.com,Central Catholic High School,Chatham,No,Not Applicable,5/23/2017,Private,Pittsburgh,No,Jennifer,(412) 805-4062,Andrade,Yes

It doesn't exactly have a lot to do with technology or even school but I learned some very valuable lessons. I was extremely unhealthy at the time and at high risk of Diabetes. It was through hard work and determination to do better that I was able to correct my bad habits and get on the path to better health. The aches and pains and lack of my regular potions of ""good"" or ""tasty"" food taught me discipline, patience, and price to pay for the greater good. ","Something I struggled with is a class im currently taking, AP Human Geography. For me personally, I've always considered myself more of a S.T.E.M oriented individual. I would actually venture to say that I am objectively more capable and most definitely more passionate about S.T.E.M subjects. It was despite this however that I ended up testing into this class. At first the class wasn't entirely bad but it was as the year began to progress that things got worse and started to get frustrated. I was never one to be unfamiliar with much and my lack of knowledge on politics and current events urked me a bit. It wasn't until around November when I met with my counselor and talked about it that I decided I wanted to get my act together. Up until then, I was content with receiving the B and carrying on. My counselor, however, exoplained to me the importance of stepping outside of your comfort zone and trying new things. I realized I was being stubborn and once I gave the textbook a solid and genuine read, my experience in the class has become much better.","I prefer working as apart of a team mostly because a good team takes a great deal of stress off of each individual. A good team splits the work load amongst each other and when each team member knows they can trust and rely on one another, work that is done by the individuals is optimized quite a bit.

The obstacles preventing me from achieving this dream consist of distance (as schools are cheaper when applying in state) and originality (I would need to create my own characters from scratch which I cannot do well).","Last Summer, I went to a church volunteering cession called Lott Carey when we learned lessons of God and managed to do volunteering and fun activities as a community. While there, I was able to connect with new people, help cultivate a garden near a national monument, spend time at a retirement home, and spend time doing something other than playing games daily. This was important to me because it helped me to realizing that not all work had to be boring.","One time where I struggled with something was understanding algebra. The challenging part of this course was attempting to understand the teacher and her teaching methods while also blocking out the loud language of my classmates. To overcome this challenge, I simply asked questions and looked up the lesson thoroughly after school.

I have heard a lot of good things about All Star Code and I am confident that this program can help me out in my future to success. I also have some knowledge on coding but truly believe I can get better with All Star Code. ","If money were no object I would love to go to The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT. MIT has proven to be the best technological school with over an 89% success rate after graduating, from 32% of the students going into a graduates program and 57% of the students going straight into the workforce. In MIT, I would want to study Electrical Engineering and Computer Science because having acquired the abilities taught in these programs one would build a good base in the future of economics which most definitely lies in the technology business. In other words, with what I have mastered at MIT, my dream is to create the future. Some obstacles that might prevent me from achieving this dream is being from a low income society, from a minority race. These qualities prevent people like me from being seen as something more in society, instead just those who have to look up to privileged race because they tend to have more opportunities. My dream is to get into MIT to make the future better for technologists.","Family is what I cherish the most in this world because it is my life outside of school, and my backbone for happiness and trust. Last summer my parents and I traveled to Ecuador to visit family. My trips to Ecuador are always memorable because they only happen once a year. All of my mother’s family lives in Ecuador, and most of my father’s family for the exception of two aunts live in Ecuador. Therefore, the family I have to connect with here in the United States is very minimal. In Ecuador I make it my mission to not relax independently, instead to use the time I have with my cousins to play and do different activities together since we are separated for most of the year. Not only do I spend time with my cousins but also my mom’s parents. Unfortunately my other grandparents have passed, so I have learned to take advantage of my time with those that are left and the rest of my family. Although I did not enroll in a summer program last year, it ended up being one of the best summers of my life.","One of the things I have struggled with this year is time management. This semester has been my only semester in high school without a GPA higher than a 4.0 because it has been difficult staying on top of my three AP Courses. Although I am grateful for previously having a 4.0, I owe it to myself to continue succeeding. The most challenging part about this drop in grades is knowing that I can get my grades up for a specific class, but not being able to because instead of devoting my entire time to one class I have to split my time up by three. To solve this problem, or at least temporarily control it, I have decided to stay after school every day of the week to minimize the amount of homework I have to do at home, leaving me more time to study for my AP classes.","Depending on the work having to be done, there are different reasons to work independently or with a group. Therefore it depends on the situation, but I am flexible working both ways. Working in a team reduces the stress level of a job because the work is divided among the group members, allowing the team to use the time more efficiently. It, however, is also important that I challenge myself if I understand the material.

Under my guidance our team was able to construct the turbine and get a perfect score.","Even though most prefer to work alone, I prefer to work in a group because it allows the group to complete the task at hand effectively due to the diversity of ideas flowing in the team making problem solving a cooperative and creative process.",3/18/2017 9:59pm,3/20/2017 11:59pm,Yes,,1,1,2,108+125+123,,4,Yes,0,Did not respond to offer,4,11th grade,"Hispanic/Latino, Caribbean",,,A.

This program would allow me to learn about coding. Coding relates to computers, computers relate to almost everything in the world. Coding is part of work and leisure. Coding is a useful skill to have and is a good ability to have. I enjoy creating things. Coding is very similar to creating art. It is a way of creating something unique or innovating upon something else. In the future, I would like to use coding for web design. Coding can be used for more than just web design. It can be used to collect data, raise awareness about things, deliver information, and even travel. Coding is a beneficial skill to possess. ","If I had an unlimited amount of money I would go to a college for graphic design and illustration.  I’d like to attend a college in the New York area.  If the college is in Brooklyn that would be good.   Graphic design is the skill of combining art and text. Illustration is an image created with pens, crayons, or pencils. I enjoy art and I feel that it is my passion.  I think that graphic design can be used to help people. It can be used to explain information in a way that is easy to understand.  There may be obstacles that would keep me from my goal.  One obstacle that may prevent me from being an artist might be a lack of demand. However, if that is the case I will need to power through this issue. I am sure I can find a way to make this career work for me.  ","Last summer I had my first paid job. I worked at Sesame Flyers International. This is an organization offers summer camps, exercise programs and it helps people who are struggling with food.  While employed at Sesame Flyers I and the other workers and I collected canned goods that were donated.  We put the donated items in boxes that we decorated. These boxes were then shared them with people who needed them.   During the day we also exercised.  Sesame Flyers has a health and fitness program that helps people in the community exercise.  This was my first paid job and it made my summer interesting.  ","In the past I struggled with my English class. I found it hard to work on the assignments. This is because of multiple reasons. While I love to read, I really didn’t like to write.  One of the other reasons that caused me to struggle with this subject is I was sometimes unsure what the teacher was looking for.  The other reason was because of a writer’s block. English always seemed challenging to me.  To help me with this struggle I tried my best to work on my writing.  I don't hesitate when I have an assignment.  I have others check my assignments for mistakes before submitting them to the teacher. As a result, I complete my assignments on time and I don’t hold on to them hoping that I will come up with the ultimate piece of writing.  ",When I am given a job I prefer to work alone. Sometime when I work in a group I am disappointed that we don’t succeed.  I would rather do work myself than rely on others or have the pressure of others relying on me. I also do not like having people watching me as I work. I would rather complete the job and then have someone check my work after.  Working in a group is not always bad.  Sometimes you need to be part of a team to complete the job.  If I had to work in a group I think that we should do our parts separately and then come together at the end. ,3/20/2017 11:12pm,3/20/2017 11:59pm,Yes,,1,1,2,122+123+909,,4,Yes,0,Dropped out pre-SI,4,11th grade,African American,,,Brooklyn High School for Law and Technology,,No,No,,Public,Brooklyn,Yes,Melanie,(347) 406-0512,France,

For the first two years I really struggled. During my third year i started to study for math everyday and I would go to my teachers everyday asking for help.

I am interested in coding for developing apps and I think that this will definitely help me tremendously and equip me with some useful skills for my future. It will also be an awesome learning experience for myself.,"1)	If money were no object, my school of choice would be NYU. If I go to NYU I would like to study a few things such as business, investing, entrepreneurship, and probably music production. I am incredibly interested in these topics and could genuinely envision myself working in such fields when I get older. I think that I would be living comfortably and be very happy with what I would be doing if I studied such topics because my level of passion for them is extremely high. However, I think that the main obstacle that would prevent me from reaching that dream is my current GPA. I had a very poor sophomore year of high school due to numerous reasons and it permanently set my GPA back. With a mediocre GPA, my chances of being admitted to such a great school like NYU are overwhelmingly slim and NYU would place me in one of the best positions to achieve my dreams.","2)	Last summer I had the privilege of working alongside my grandfather.

Working with my grandfather was really an eye-opening experience and I am looking forward to working with him again this summer.","3)	One of my biggest struggles was my sophomore year of high school. My initial adviser showed very little to no support for me and it had a major negative impact on my GPA. I was in too many difficult classes that I was just unable to handle and my adviser did not make the necessary changes that he needed to make for me to succeed. Thus, they affected my other grades since I devoted most my effort in the two difficult classes. The entire year I tried my best to tough it out and make the best out of it but in the end, I learned that I need to be a much more proactive person and seek for more help when needed","4)	Whether I prefer to work solo or in a group depends on what is being worked on or what the assignment is.

I would very likely consider other universities such as the University of California group.  At college I would study Software Engineering. I find this major to be very interesting and stimulating to me. It is a dynamic field constantly changing and with ever growing opportunities. I also want to study Software Engineering because I have always been handy with computers and electronics, the idea of learning the languages that can create apps and programs fascinates me and I find it amazing to see the progress that has been done in this field. The magnitude of the applications that can be developed and the number of industries that benefit from their progress is constantly growing. One challenging obstacle may be the cost of getting the education I need in order to compete in this field.  Also challenging may be the competition from students who may have more resources than I do wanting to pursue the same course of study. I know many students use expensive services to assist them in applying for college and I wonder if that will make a difference when our applications are reviewed.

There are two schools that I am strongly interested in, which are the School of Engineering and the School of Architecture and Planning. These two schools will allow me to study architecture and engineering, which are the majors I would like to study. I have always wanted to study architecture and engineering because I am captivated by designs of homes, bridges and other structures.","Last summer, I attended a STEM program at CCNY. In the program, I took two college-level courses. I took Calculus and Physics, each course was three hours long.

","One time I struggled with something in school was with a term research paper. The challenging part of it was that I had to find a topic in math and do research on the topic in order to find new information on it. For instance, my topic was representing numbers in other bases besides the base of ten, so I decided to look for patterns within the representation of the number and the base in which it was represented in. What I found challenging was primarily finding a way of how to find patterns between the numbers with the fact that there are many numbers out there, so it was difficult to come to one rule. Unfortunately, I was not able to come to a specific rule. But I still had to write a paper, so I decided to write about the different types of patterns I found between the different sets of numbers.

An obstacle that might prevent me from doing that would be my grades because my average is a B. I believe my grades would be an obstacle because most colleges want a student with a majority of A’s and a fewer B’s. I also hope that being a leader in my community, captain of my swim team, and also being a volunteer will allow me to overcome my average grades, by being a more diverse student with various skills and qualities.","Last summer, I moved to New York from Georgia and participated in various sports camps. I was apart of a track and field and swimming program with new coaches. It allowed for me to work with more experienced coaches than I was accustomed to. When I went for the first track & field practice I knew the coach was a good coach because his workouts were longer and more difficult. I practiced my 400m, 800m, and 1600m with this coach and I improved drastically, when I was competing. It was important for me to practice track and field over the summer because I enjoyed it. It was also important to me because I intend to be the best and to continually improve within that sport.","I love to run and I love to swim, and have continuously received awards and recognition for my accomplishments in both. From since I could remember, I have being running and racing be anyone who wanted to race me. As for swimming, I started taking lessons when I was 10 years old. It was a struggle at first, but after hours of practice and swim camps, I became better. It’s exciting playing these sports because one refreshes me and the other make me come alive!

Although I played recreational sports, those two in particular were always easy for me. I never had to prepare or practice for any events. Once I joined the swim and cross country teams, everything changed. It was difficult! During practice, I was tired, out of breath, my stomach hurt and I felt nauseous daily. I was usually the last person to finish in the drills. I continued to push myself and little by little my endurance got better and I saw improvements. I began looking forward to practice and decided to do extra in order to become even better. I did strength & endurance, conditioning, read online articles, asked coaches for guidance, spent an extra hour in the pool and ran outdoors on my days off. I wanted to do everything it took to get better. During my first meets, I was nervous. I did my best but my times were not great. I was disappointed but my coaches and teammates were satisfied with my performance and continued to encourage me. As time went by, I got better and was able to run 3.2 miles in 19.32 minutes. As for swimming, I was awarded the “Most Improved” student. Looking back, I realized that I wasn’t challenged in the other sports and that was the reason they came easy to me.","I prefer working as part of a team.

","If money were no object, where would you go to college, and what would you study?  Well, to play it smart, many qualities would have to be looked at such as, what schools I got into, what school has the best grade, which college/university offers grade A courses that teach my minor & majors, but if we are just talking about any college, I would honestly have to say, Howard University or University of Michigan. Both universities are terrific at demonstrating diversity, character, & scholarship on a regular basic. Also , both universities offer my double-majors of Fashion Design & the study of African American History, with my minor of Dance. When it comes to college and this even goes for my dreams , not even money can stop me from pursuing what I want to achieve. I mean sure being realistic, in many cases, you will have obstacles like time (travel between college and home) , & money , but I'm a person who believes that with any dream, lies a reality waiting to be created, and I refuse to let anything stop me from being the best me.

It's important to me that as a young minority, I break all stereotypes of not being important to this world, & that my skin does not matter to the building of this county, and stay busy in programs that will benefit me, and better me, while also starting young to build the building blocks to my career. ","I can say personally, It doesn't take me a while to adjust, but a very difficult transition in my life that I had to deal with was the move from being a full-time high school student, to a part-time high school and college student. I was only 15 when it happened, and I didn't think of it as much until I got into college and sen that many rules were different, but in a good way. The way my high school was and is still build is that, they care about their image so much, very much more than their own student body (sad), and by that point, being already a rising junior in my high school, I was put in this mindset of be guarded and quiet, having to fake a smile, never speak even it is to ask a question, and it was hard to relax. So that let me to sometime crash and break, panic about the workload, & constant unnecessary stressing. But eventually, I broke out my shell, & realize that I got this. This is college.

Then again, the group may have that one slacker that makes you have to pick up the workload and slack, due to the fact that 1 grade is all of your grades, and you can afford a bad grade, no one can.

Another reason why UCLA interests me is because they have decent programs for most of the careers I have considered throughout school including engineering  and programming.

My role was to teach kids about engineering as a teachers assistant.

Teaching children also caused me to realize my skills as a leader and how to take control. ,"During my first few months of joining my school's wrestling team I always felt that I was a lousy wrestler and was not winning many of my matches. Despite the amount of times I have been put down by a loss, every loss would cause me to realize that there was something wrong and that it could be fixed. As a result I trained harder and gave it my all, persevering through the hard times. When I won my first match I realized that if there is a will, there is a way. Even though I currently may not be the best wrestler, it gives me motivation to keep on pushing forward to become better.","I believe that everyone has their own strengths and weakness; because of this I would prefer to work as a part of a team. Working with a team can have you cover someone else's weakness while someone else can help with one's own weakness.

In college, I plan to major in business and hopefully can start my own business through a website or app. I think the All Star Code program can provide me knowledge and guide me through to learning the essential coding skills that I may need.  Also, I want to gain some experiences at top tech companies and try new things. ","If money were no object, I would go to Harvard and study Business because I hope to become a successful entrepreneur. I would go to Harvard so that I can leave my comfort zone of going to school in the city and try something new. That way, I can gain different experiences and improve myself in many ways. Also, since money would be no object, I would go into entrepreneurship because the chance of possibly failing and going bankrupt wouldn't problem.

Some obstacles that might prevent me from achieving this dream is that there will be many competition and not having enough money may also get in the way. ","Something that I did last summer that was important to me was playing basketball with my friends. This hobby was important to me because it helped me exercise regularly and keep my body healthy. Also, playing basketball allowed me to be productive and push myself to try harder. Further more, it made me have a clear mind whenever I went through a bad mood. Also, it's important to me because it taught me that no matter how great your opponent is, working as a team cooperatively can help you over power them. ","A time when I struggled with something was during a chess game at a tournament. The challenging part about the game was that there were numerous moves that I could make and if I made a wrong move, it can cost me to lose the game. So, I played carefully and made sure that every move I made, my pieces were protected and that my pieces had a strong control of the board. In addition, I always planned a few moves ahead so that I had different strategies of check mating my opponent.  Also, I tried my best to avoid my opponent's traps by always thinking about his best move possible and what his plans were. ","I prefer working as part of a team because when you work together, you accomplish more and go farther in terms of your goals. Also, when you work with others, everyone can share their own ideas or thoughts which can show you multiple possibilities of how to do a certain task. This will allow the group to discuss and develop on each other's ideas. Another reason is that working as a team decreases the workload and prevents you from having stress.  Overall, working as a team will provide more quality to the work or project since different people with each having a unique perspective are working together.

I also volunteered with the Tianjin Youth Volunteers Association and worked as a tour guide for the Tianjin Museum. Upon returning home, I got a job as a waiter/cashier at a place called Oporto BBQ.

With the problem at hand, I did not panic but rather set it in my mind to get a 5 on the exam. After I month of diligent studying, I breezed to a 5 on the test.","At times I prefer working alone, and at times I enjoy working with others; there are benefits to both.

This is because of two reasons. The first reason is solely due to its location. It is very close by where I live, and the commute would be tolerable.

I've never actually coded before, however Ihave heard about coding before. Therefore I want to learn more about coding in the All Star Code Summer Intensive.
I was also going through the website and found many inpirational students who have been part of this program in the past. Seeing how they were successful made me want to join the program too. I am always open to try new things. Even though I might not know how to code I am really interested in learning how to. I am also very determined that if I get in this program I will dedicate hard work to be able to learn as much as possible in the All Star Code Summer Intensive.","If money were no object, I would like to go to Stanford University or Duke University. Well ever since I was little I would always say I want to become a doctor. I would always love when my parents call me Doctor Chauca. However as time passed I started gaining more passion for technology and other careers. What I would study in either of these colleges is engineering.  This is because when I got into my current high school I was introduced to Pre-Engineering. At first it all seemed complicated, however as time passed by I started to understand the concepts my teacher was teaching in class. After that my passion for Engineering started to grow more and more. Currently I’m in another shop class now, I’m in the A+Computer/Networking Repair shop class. I have to take this class for 1 semester then, at the end of the semester I have to choose 1 of the 3 shop classes, however I will only get into one of them. Therefore I am still really confident that I want to study Engineering for my junior and senior year, so then I can be ahead for when college comes around and I can continue to study any type of Engineering. The obstacles that might prevent me from achieving this dream might be the SAT test. This is because recently I have heard that colleges now focus more on the SAT scores then on the student’s actual grades.  I have really good grades but since colleges might focus more on the SAT test I’m concerned for my future. Especially because we don’t have a class in school that prepares us for the SAT’s. However I will continue to research more about the SAT exams and how to get ready for them, because I really want to get into a good college and study engineering. Another obstacle that might prevent me from achieving my dream is money however this question was based on what if money was no object. Another obstacle that would prevent me from achieving this dream is myself because when I was little I always wanted to become a doctor, I still do. However I am more focused on studying engineering but my parents want me to become a doctor so I don’t want to let them down. I am also worried that when I get to college my mind will change and I would like to study another career. Even though I have heard in researches that students in college would change their mind 4 times or more, I am still concerned because I want to get into college and know that I will study. However this might be difficult with all the careers I want to study for the future because I might have to study only one of them. ","Last summer was a really significant for me. This is because last summer I spent more time with my family.  At the beginning of summer break I thought it was all going to be just studying and playing video games. However it wasn’t that, I did study throughout the summer. I also did play video games once in a while.  However what is really significant to me is that I spend more time with my family. We went on some cool trips, they weren’t the most expensive trips, but what counted was that we all spend quality time together. One trip we went to was to go pick fruits and enjoy nature. We went to this place where you can pick out your own fresh fruits. This really helped me relieve all the stress I have from studying. It was also nice to pick out our own fruit rather then going to the supermarket.  Rather then being on our phones us all enjoyed the nature. There were also 3 mazes in this place. I have never been in a maze before, however all my life I’ve wanted to try out a maze. We created groups it was my mom and I versus my dad and my sister. Whoever got out first won, this was really fun because we would bump into each other constantly. At the end my mom and me ended up winning but it wasn’t about competition it was mostly about spending time together. My sister that would always want to win didn’t even get mad this time; she was having way too much fun to even realize that she lost. Anyways we had other fun trips like going to beaches and also visiting other family. I really enjoyed that summer because we spent more quality time together. It’s difficult to spend time together especially since sometimes we couldn’t go out do to work and other reasons. However that summer we spent a lot of time together, which was way better the being on my phone or playing video games. This time also helped relieve my stress from studying so much. I would like to repeat that summer all over again. ","I’m not really the best in Science. A time I struggled with something was in my earth science class. At first I was scared because recently the previous year I was in freshman year and my Living Environment didn’t teach us, so I had to teach myself and go over past regents exams. I did however pass the Living Environment Regents. Now that I was going into sophomore year I was concerned because I didn’t want to get another science teacher that would teach us again. Luckily I didn’t get another science teacher that wouldn’t teach. I was really excited to see what my current earth science teacher would teach me. As time passes by I started noticing that I was struggling. I usually got 80s in my exams, this wasn’t a good grade, well for my parents they expected more from me because in my other classes I would get 90s. What was most challenging about this was that I would sometimes feel down and I would feel like I’m not smart enough for science. I would sometimes believe that I would struggle in all my future science classes. However, I didn’t let this prevent me from trying to get 90s. Therefore I decided I had to study more on this subject. I decided that I would go over and rewrite my notes everyday after school after I have completed all my other assignments. I continued to do this, however I would rewrite my notes for other classes too, so then I wouldn’t start struggling in other classes. All this rewriting my notes really started helping me more. I would understand the content more better I would also feel more confident to raise my hand and answer question. All this hard work really started showing in my test scores. I started get 90s or higher in my exams. Recently in an exam I got back I got a 99, now I feel more confident in my earth science class. I still continue to study so I can maintain these grades. Another time when I struggled was in my shop class. My shop class was based on Pre-Engineering and it was really different from freshman year. The most challenging part of this struggle was that Pre-Engineering was a completely new subject for me. At first I thought I wouldn’t like Pre-Engineering. I would always get confuse while working on labs and other assignments. However I soon overcame these obstacles. I would rewrite my notes for this class too, because from my earth science experienced this really helped me understand the subject more. Therefore it would probably work for my shop class to. That wasn’t the only thing I did, I would also go online and research some of the concepts we were learning in the class, I would especially look up concepts I wouldn’t understand. This really started boosting up my average. At first I started with an average of 82 in that class. At the final marking period I ended up getting a 98 in my final exam, which brought my average to a 96. Therefore now I really understood this subject and I felt confident enough learning this new concept, it was a challenge for me but I have overcome these obstacles and struggles. ","Well it depends because if I am put on a team where no one want to cooperate in doing work then I prefer working solo. However if I would have to pick one I would pick working on a team. This is because working on a team would probably get more things done faster. When you are working on a team there are more people you can ask for help when you don’t understand something. For instance someone in the team could understand something really well, while another person might have some difficulty in understanding. Therefore the person who understands something very well could help the teammates who are struggling understand something better. The team could help each other and exchange ideas. Teamwork is better because it allows people to collaborate and brainstorm ideas better. Two or more people are always better then working alone because two brains work better then one. Plus working individually would put too much stress in one person. When working on teams you might get something your teammates don’t get and your teammates might get something you don’t get. Together you can exchange ideas and get more done, then just working alone and trying to solve problems by yourself.",3/5/2017 11:17am,3/20/2017 11:59pm,Yes,,1,1,2,112+112+115,,4,Yes,27,Did not respond to offer,4,10th grade,Hispanic/Latino,,,Queens Vocational and Technical High School,,Yes,Yes,,CTE,"Corona, NY",No,Luis ,(646) 500-1662,Chauca,

It was very challenging because of many reasons. First, because of me being in a class with Sophomores and Juniors. It was hard feeling comfortable being in a class with older people especially starting high school. Another challenge was the math itself.  The older students all had an advantage by having been taught at least the basics by their freshman teachers. I was always a step behind. I started to go to morning tutoring sessions and i started to get the hang of it. By being there i realized many other students in my class went there and I started to make friends.

I would want to study some sort of computer science/engineering in conjunction with sociology because that would allow me to use skills I have learned and will continue to learn in computer science/engineering and apply them to real world situations. This is where Stanford’s location would come into play because ultimately I want to start my own business, and that business would revolve around solving a real world problem such as housing for the homeless, substance abuse, and equality for people of all types. The biggest obstacle preventing me from achieving this dream would be getting admitted into Stanford. The distance Stanford is away from home would be an additional source of difficulty.

It was hard to conceptualize with the fact that my actions could be so influential to someone. I was afraid that my sister would develop flaws that young adolescent me possessed, thus it made me much more conscious of my actions.

I have been playing basketball since the age of 7 and I a good at it. The University of Kentucky has an amazing basketball program and coach.  Coach john Calipari the head coach is excellent at producing NBA level talent.  If money was not an object University of Kentucky will be my first choice, I would not have to worry about the burden of high college tuition on both myself and my parents along with the travel distance from home.  University of Kentucky will give me the opportunity to pursue and achieve both my basketball dream and afford me a good college education for my academic career plans.  Business is such a broad area but my dream is to start a business that will help the needy in some way and possibly youth with passions for sports.  The obstacles that might prevent me from achieving my dream are high cost of tuition, University of Kentucky being an out of state school for me, my parents are supporting both my sister and I to attend college , injury and lack of support.","2. My family is a very important part of my life.  Last summer my grandparents took all 5 of their grandchildren on a vacation to their island of St. Vincent, W.I. where they were born and raised.  I never had the opportunity to visit.  When my parents last visited my mother was pregnant with me.  My sister visited when she was very young and surprisingly had some great memories.  Visiting St. Vincent gave me the opportunity to learn about not just my grandparents but who I am also.  My grandfather the historian he loves to be gave us the time of our lives.  He not only had us experience historical sites of the island but took us back to so many areas of his childhood and taught us about his life and his struggles.  My grandmother was extremely happy to expose us to the rich food and produce and the lands of her parents.  I not only learned about where my grandparents are form first hand but I become a lot closer with my grandparents and my cousins.  Also this trip was very fun and relaxing and gave me a whole different perspective on life.","3. In elementary school and middle school I was always very good in math.  I was able to work math problems out in my head.  In middle school I was placed in accelerated math and continued in high school.  In the 8th and 9th grade I began to struggle in math with common core algebra and geometry, my grade was slowly decreasing.  The challenging part about this was how fast the information was now being taught and the difficulty I had retaining information which never seemed to affect me in the past.  I felt a lot of pressure to get high grades because I was in the accelerated program and wanted to stay in the accelerated classes.  I tried attending extra help as much as I could but it still was not helping.  I spoke to my parents and they decided to pay for a tutor.  I cut out some distractions such as playing my video games which I spent a lot of time  on  in order to devote more time studying math.  I was able to put more focus on math and along with the one and one from the tutor my grades began to improve.","
4. I prefer working as a team because I believe teamwork makes the dream work.  A team opens up many different opinions on how to reach goals and gives you things to think about that you may have not realized.  As a basketball player team work is very important.  All the pressure in a team is not on just one person.  The work within a team gets done faster and more efficiently.  In a team we learn from each other.",3/20/2017 6:53am,3/20/2017 11:59pm,Yes,,2,1,1,132+907+123,,4,Yes,35,Rejected ASC Offer,4,10th grade,African American,,,Valley Stream South High School,,No,No,,Public,Valley Stream,No,Maria,(917) 642-0705,Johnson,

There, I would study law at the Harvard Law School. My interest in law is the result of seeing the effects that the first roll out of the new administration’s travel ban had on refugees and immigrants at an airport that was broadcasted on the news. It was truly inspiring witnessing the many lawyers that rushed to the airport to work on the behalf of the refugees and immigrants. However, If there were to be an obstacle that might hinder my progress in pursuing this interest, it would be trying to stay focused and alleviate myself from various distractions.","Last summer, in June, I participated in a program with Yale University named Yale Young Global Scholars(YYGS). This particular program was located in Singapore. It was an honor being able to be involved in a program with Yale and travel all the way to Southeastern Asia for the first time. It was a week long and it consisted of many seminars and lectures of different subjects, hosted and taught by various Yale students and professors. Additionally, we were extensively exposed to Singapore’s culture and learned about how it was able to grow to such a state of success, in a short amount of time. This program was so important to me because it opened my eyes to many subjects and topics that I would have never been interested in previously. I also have a strong passion for travel and being immersed into lifestyles and cultures that are totally different from mine and America’s in general.","Sophomore year is definitely a big challenge for me. I’m taking challenging courses and the workload is a lot heavier. Two subjects in particular that has brought on the most challenges were Algebra II Honors and AP World History. These are classes that require more analyzing and problem solving at a level that was not required the previous year. In the beginning of this year, I did not meet my personal academic goals it was very hard to accept. This is because I did exceptionally well in all my courses freshman year. It was an adjustment experiencing this new level of difficulty. I had no choice but to change the way I studied.

I got to see the procedures that doctors do when an emergency goes down in the ER, the morals needed when deciding who to save in an epidemic, and even got to try injecting medication (even though it was just locating a vein on a model arm and injecting water). This experience was important to me because I want my career to head in the direction of medicine, especially towards the field of Anesthesiology. Doing this enlightened the difficulties that I am bound to encounter on my journey there.","A personal project for me was becoming intimate with the field of video editing. I chose to learn about this because I know that not only will it be one of my subjects in high school, but it is also a useful skill to have that has a lifelong potency to it. The challenging part about it was when I decided to go beyond just basic cutting, pasting, and adding clips together. I wanted to get my hands on how things like key frames work and how certain effects work in relation to key frames. Sony Vegas was no problem for me, but when I moved to After Effects, I didn’t even know how to press play on the video I imported. I knew that there was a lot of work ahead of me. To work towards fixing this problem, I watched all the videos I can possibly lay my hands on from YouTube. I just paid attention and watched to the end of all of them. Slowly but surely, I developed a framework from the bottom up for myself that allowed me to use the program to my needs. It got to the point that I was watching these videos all the time, even on the train. I had to get an app on my phone to download these videos as well for when my signal would run out. When I was done with a batch of videos, I would try and put what I learned to use by trying to edit a video on After Effects. A few months later, and I now know how to use After Effects just as well as Sony Vegas.","I prefer working solo whenever possible. This is primarily so that the ‘blaming game’ for missing work can be avoided, resulting in an entire group of people having a bad time rather than one. Also, there’s the chance that one person in the group completes an assignment to the point that it’s ‘just done’ and looks bad, just so that it can be done. Working solo allows me to create what I want with no barrier stopping me, and if something goes wrong, the person to blame is myself, not other people. All it takes is one unmotivated person to destroy the will of the entire group. However, working alone isn’t always possible, especially for large-scale projects.

As a result, I struggled through the first semester with that class, but over time I was able to adapt to the learning process.

This internship can allow me to advance my skills as a computer programmer and make me have better opportunities as an adult.,If money was not an object then I would attend California Berkeley University and study computer science and business.

Well last summer I attended a program called Upperline School of Code which I was suggested to by another coding non-profit organization known as ScriptEd in NYC. This weeks long course of code took place over the summer and with a long distance away from home every morning. I anxiously woke up every morning fearing a tardy which I did have several times but made up for it by cleaning up the classroom after class had ended. I learned Swift which is a coding program for IOS. I learned how to use xcode and implement it into making apps. Sadly, I have grown rust as I did not have xcode on my computer. I hope to someday have enough time to run an emulator and use xcode to learn more.","Currently I am struggling with working on an IB project where my partner has no clue as to what we should do. This project consists of hard work and presenting slides on a literary work. We have to speak in front of the class as well as record the performance, in order to send it to those at IB. Now one of the major problems I have with recording in front of the class is the fact that many can speak. I like to record videos and edit them afterwards for a nice polish. I asked my teacher if I could edit it after the recording and she said no that it wouldn’t be possible. That made me lose a little comfort and now I am struggling to have a nice composure. I have to have nice slides and a well written script to present. After seeing many presentations I see that many students use the same path and completely make the class disengaged.

I heard about All Star Code from a friend, Anthony Baldeosingh, who attended the program before. He explained to me that it was a great idea to apply. He learned a great deal, and has benefitted from the information he was taught to study more about the field in his free time.

","This academic year, I have been struggling in my AP Language & Composition class. Not necessarily putting blame on the teacher of the class, however, this is the first year that this course was implemented in 11th grade English. I feel as though the class is very unorganized with homework and class work, in which too many different assignments are given at once. For example, my teacher assigned the class to read the novel Siddhartha in a week for homework. From my perspective, I believe that reading this book should be the main course of the work load. Unfortunately, more would be assigned to go along with it — including worksheets, research, and more smaller readings. I was becoming more and more stressed out as days went on in the year and my grade slipped a little to a B+. When I saw this, I decided to go talk to my teacher to communicate better ways to manage my time. This helped me because she (my teacher) provided me with advice, study tips, and even hints to what is coming next in the curriculum to prepare for.

Academic wise which I consider to be the most important aspect, I would engage myself in an engineering/tech related career, but at the same time I would like to include some other study that is more philosophical/artistic rather than logic based. I intend to go to a particular college not because of its national/global recognition, but because it matches with my interests and at the same time can challenge me academically.

If there were any obstacles that would restrain me from achieving this dream, I would suspect those obstacles being related to qualification needs due to the fact that certain positions are increasingly becoming more competitive. ","An event that was very important to me from the past summer was moving to New York from Chicago. The significance of this event is obviously the transitioning of cities and the complications of moving. I have moved five times in my life so in a way I was accustomed to the situation. However, this recent move was different because in my 16 years of life, I spent 8 years in Chicago which meant that I made many friends and memories there over the years. At the same though was enthusiastic about the move and I came to understand that life is full of changes. ","A moment in my life that I struggled with something (more on a personal level rather than academic) was my recent move from Chicago to New York which relates to my second response. At first, I thought that it was going to be a breeze since I had experienced it throughout my life, but I came to realize that I underestimated the the effects. I had to make new friends, start in a new school, and all the other things that go along with it. I spent a lot of time before school started being reflexive with myself and observing the new surroundings. I wanted to make a good first impression with my new pears, teachers, and the community as a whole. I fulfilled my promises by earning spots in the school soccer and basketball team where I was able to make new friends with other student athletes. In school, I also met my expectations by having an average grade of 94% in my first semester. I was very pleased with myself with the outcome of the process because I did not only achieve my goals of becoming part of the community, but I also learned more about myself as a whole.  ","I prefer working as part of a team. I have always had the belief that taking part in a collaborative environment you can achieve more. In certain situations, I think working independently can have its pros.

I was struggling and frustrated with the school work the teacher for that class was giving me. Also I had other classes to worry about and projects. I had so much frustration for myself. And what was challenging was that I would try to get help but I didn't see any improving results. Then one day, I thought to myself, and decided to stop being frustrated and do something about it. I knew that there was an error somewhere in my work. All I had to do was to find where is it that I had to Improve. I took the time to go back to my past classwork, tests and quizzes and look for any repetitive mistakes there were in my work. I realized that it was my grammar and my need to remember concepts on what I was learning. I began to study and focus more on correcting my grammar and the way I would speak to my teacher. I was also graded on how I spoke Spanish in class. After a while I began to see that I was getting better grades on my tests and quizzes which was what I felt better about. But there was stool room for improvement and work to be done. In the end I was satisfied and happy with the progress I was making in the class and getting better grades that reflected my potential.","I can work solo and in a team, but if i were to choose one between the two, I would work part of a team. Its because I love to hear feed back from others about my work. I would like to hear other members ideas and probably tell me where I need to improve in my work so I can use that feed back and improve. Finally I'd like to get to know more about my teammates and classmates and see how they work.",3/19/2017 11:53pm,3/20/2017 11:59pm,Yes,,1,1,2,108+118+909,,4,Waitlist,69,Opted out of waitlist,3,10th grade,Hispanic/Latino,,,Cristo Rey New York High School,,Yes,Not Applicable,,Other,New York,No,Jazmine ,(917) 932-5138,Santiago,

Ranging from website building to software developing, I would like to gain a strong understanding of computer programming, and exposure to its application in the outside world. With this knowledge, I wish to incorporate them into aspects of my daily life, establish a stronger sense of communication through technology in my society and learn to work within a real-life tech company. ","If money were no object, then I would try to attend Harvard University. At Harvard, I would try to study Medicine and Chemistry. I want to study Medicine because I would like to understand how different kinds of medical treatment, including antibiotics and other kinds of pills, work within the human body. I want to study Chemistry since it plays a crucial role in everyday life, where chemical reactions within the environment occur regularly, and can be predicted through a firm understanding on the chemical bonds between compounds and the environment’s effect on the reaction. I would like the chance to go to Harvard because I want to be challenged academically. At Harvard, I would most likely encounter academic and social obstacles, including difficult subjects and competitive peers that would test my ability to work efficiently while playing a role in the community. Additionally, I see my race becoming an issue during my time at college. Nonetheless, facing obstacles that push me to think creatively and extensively, while getting involved in clubs, groups and projects throughout campus would help me learn where I stand academically in the vast student body, and challenge myself to excel beyond my own limits. I would get the chance to leave my comfort zone, meet new people from across the globe and help solve major worldly problems. Likewise, encountering stereotypical labeling based on the color of my skin would only further compel me to work hard and exceed society’s expectations.","One thing I did last summer that was very important to me was participating in Prep for Prep’s Aspects Program. In this program, scholars from different schools met up at NYU and were divided into small groups. Within each group, we talked about the qualities of a good leader, and how we could become role models for others to follow through hard work, consistency and determination. Through analytical reading and role-playing exercises, we were introduced to several examples of well-renowned leaders throughout the world, and learned some key aspects of leadership, including learning how to listen to and work with others in order to reach a common goal. This was important to me since it helped me recognize where I can make improvements when it comes to working with other people, and it taught me to keep an open mind to new ideas. Learning how to become a leader allowed me to consider opinions beyond my own thoughts more often, and rethink my way of approaching group assignments and projects. ","One time I struggled with something would have to be during Winter Term at my school, Phillips Academy Andover. At the time, I was taking a course called Asian Religions and my final assignment was to write up a 5-page essay on Sexism in Buddhism. While completing this major assignment, I struggled with managing my time wisely, organizing the paper in a clear, cohesive manner and making sure I truly answered the prompt. In order to ensure my success, I decided to set up specific times during the school day devoted solely on gathering evidence from passages I read in class, and compiling them into a separate Word Document to use later. Afterwards, I would push myself to write at least one page per day, to make sure that I was constantly adding to and made the requirement for my final paper. In this essay, the prompt asked scholars to present both sides of an argument and describe reasons in Buddhism for the unequal status of women and reasons for the equal status of women, while proving them. To properly organize the paper, I decided to write up an introduction that described the status of nuns and maechi in Buddhism and Thai culture, while giving a brief overview on the two reasons I had for both sides of the argument. Using this introduction as my outline, I talked about the reasons in Buddhism for the unfair status of women in the first half of the essay, and transitioned into the reasons in Buddhism for their equal status.  Finally, making sure I answered the prompt correctly was another issue I was afraid of. At times, I didn’t know if I offered a valid reason in one of my two arguments that stuck to the main topic, and I could not tell if the evidence I used was strong enough. As a result, I went to my teacher for help during Conference Period, to ask him if the points I chose to write about were powerful enough to use and actually proved my argument. ","Personally, I enjoy doing both. When working independently, I approach a situation at a pace that I find both comfortable and efficient. After brainstorming and jotting down several ideas either mentally or physically, on a sheet of paper, I select the best method to use and follow through with it to reach my end goal. I feel as though working independently can be empowering since it helps me to concentrate and focus more on my task, pushes me to think comprehensively and puts me in a position to make my own decisions. Nonetheless, working as part of a team has its own benefits as well. For one, working in a group encourages the collaboration of several, unique ideas. With different people contributing their own thoughts, a group can look over and refine their ideas to create the most suitable, appropriate and effective method of handling a situation. Likewise, working as part of a team makes the process less strenuous and difficult. By dividing the work evenly amongst team members, the time it takes to complete a project can be minimized, and the assignment can be finished with sufficient time for review.

","           If money did not exist today, I would aspire to study in American University's school of Communications. As a young man who identifies himself as a person who's very social and very energetic when it comes to talking to people, I would definitely want to study journalism in AU. Speaking to people and being very open with others in the real world is something I'm very comfortable in doing. My current communications skills are currently pretty good for a young man. However, pursuing a career in communications, and more in depth, journalism, would be something extremely worth doing in my opinion. 
          Why would I choose American University's school of business as a school I would attend to pursue a career in communications/journalism? Simply because the capital of the United States is basically the best place in the country to study in if you want to expand your horizons as a communications major or a journalist major. Being in contact with people from the nations capital can open many opportunities to interview people and write interesting stories about what's going on today. 
","During the summer of 2016, one of the biggest things of my life happened:I got my first job! I have done many internships beforehand, but none of them were ever paid, they were pretty much just for the learning experience and future recommendations along the way. The job I had finally acquired that summer was in a restaurant, an American-Italian restaurant by my house. One night my family and I went out to eat there, and at the time I had nothing to do on my free time, so I just asked the manager if he needed any extra help around the restaurant. He indicated that he did indeed need help, that he had a position open for a dishwasher. I was ready, willing, and able to work at the time so I immediately gave him my contact information so he could let me know what day I should come in. I started the following week. Dish washing was miserable, it was worse than I thought it would be. It required a lot of hard work and manual labor, and the hours were rough as well. However, the pay was good for a teenager who had no bills to take care of. Later on, I was tired of dishwashing and I asked the manager if he could pull some strings and make me a waiter, since I believed that I knew the menu well enough, and that I could socialize well with costumers. Luckily for me, he believed in my abilities and had me training as a waiter for the next three weeks. I successfully became a part time server at Trufa Restaurant, worked during brunch hours and dinner hours, met many great people and have had many great experiences along the way. Having this job was really important for me because instead of being stuck at home doing nothing, I was out being productive, working hard, meeting new people, and ultimately expanding my horizons as a person. Another great reason why it was so important to me was because it meant that I could now be able to manage my own money. I had opened up a high school checkings account and started saving money from there. Ever since that summer, I've been employed part time, focusing on school and just carrying on with the rest of my life. ","      My sophomore year of high school was a very interesting year for me. It was full of many happy moments as well as many disappointments. During the second semester of my sophomore year, I had come to realize that I was in danger of going to summer school for Geometry class. As a result of failing the first semester due to a lack of understanding of the subject and also due to a lack of caring to improve, I found myself in danger of attending summer school. I have never attended summer school before, and I did not want my sophomore year to be my first year in which I did. I had known that failing one semester of a core subject automatically meant summer school, so I was already nervous and discouraged with everything, up until I spoke with my Geometry teacher. She had told me that the only way I can pass the class and dodge summer school was if I did exceptionally well on the Regents which was soon creeping up on me. She mentioned that I needed at least an 85 or higher on that exam in order for her to pass me. I could barely pass her exams with a 70, so aiming for a mastery grade of an 85 was like aiming for the stars. The only thing I had left to do was hope for the best and study extremely hard, and so I did! I found myself being tutored by a close friend of mine who had taken the class the year before, taking practice exams at home and even watching Geometry tutorial videos on youtube religiously! 
      The day of the test I was pretty nervous, but I did pull through. I ended up getting a solid 78 on the exam. When I heard that, I was so upset, let alone disappointed. I told myself that my life was over, summer school was becoming a reality. However, my teacher relieved me of the stress and told me it was a pretty difficult exam, and passed me with that 78. She passed me for the first semester, and my second semester grade was extremely close to an 80! I was really proud of myself because I put in the work on a subject that I strongly struggled with, and in the end, the hard work paid off!
","When it comes to working and being productive, I love to work as part of a team. I believe that working with others is a great way to help your peers grow and learn better. Another big reason why I enjoy working as a group with other people is because everyone gets to participate. I, for one, love to participate and love to interact with teachers and students as well, and being able to see your fellow group members participate with you is also great; everyone has a say in things. Also, as an individual who believes that being a leader is important, working as a group with others is a good opportunity to show off my leadership skills in the classroom. Being able to work well and communicate well with others is an essential skill one must have to go far in life, and I strongly believe that being paired into groups will definitely bring that out not only in myself, but with other students as well.

I would like to have a foot up on others since it's a growing competitive market, and want to be prepared for college courses in CS.","If money were no object, I would go to University of California, Berkeley college, and continue to study Computer Science. I would choose Berkeley college since research would lead me to believe they have one of the most effect and thorough CS programs in America, as well as putting me into a new environment as I've lived in New York my whole life, without much travel.
 I have been using computers since a very early age, and I developed a love for computers in my early age. As I've matured and looked into career paths involving computers, I came upon the idea of working as a software engineer, and I found myself interested in the inner workings of programs I use daily. To continue to study a field I have taken an interest in since I've been a child I think is a privilege, as many people my age aren't certain of what they want to pursue as a career, and to be proficient at something I've held interest in for a very long time I would imagine is very satisfying.
An obstacle holding me back from achieving my dream is the lack of motivation I had for the first 2 years of high school. My grades suffered greatly as a result, and I found myself in a cycle of disappointment in myself and from my parents. While I've gained motivation and focus, I've improved phenomenally as a student, going from a B- average to an A- average, my grades from 9th and 10th grade still threaten my future when it comes to applying to colleges. ","Last Summer, I admittedly did not do much. This was in between the time of getting my 80 averages and me deciding to focus on school, and I stayed in a limbo of doing nothing day-to-day. What I’m most proud of is continuing my hobby as a computer builder, building my third computer from scratch, along with helping my friends build theirs. This was important to me because building a computer was another dream I had as a kid. I had a deep fascination for them, and it blew me away that I could build my own, but it wasn’t until I was 14 that I got to build one, and to this day I’m still extremely proud and fascinated with putting together such a complex machine by hand."," A time I struggled with something was when I first started putting effort into school. In Freshman and Sophomore year, I did very little work and barely got by. Coming into my junior year, I finally decided that I couldn’t not care about school if I wanted to be the most succeed, and in time be the most successful person in my family. I had to immediately force myself into a productive work ethic, study, and put real effort into my education. Going from doing nothing all day and slacking off, to focusing in school, finishing homework, and studying, was extremely difficult to readjust my life. However, I succeeded in my goal, and my overall average went from an 80 to a 93 in the first month, and I take a great amount of pride in that.","I prefer working solo. This is because I dislike the feeling of having to depend on someone else to do something. This likely stems from group work in school being slacked on, getting a bad for someone else’s work in my group, etc. While I do not believe I can do everything myself better than my group mates, I rather be able to take full responsibility of my work instead of feeling either like I’m weighing my team down or I’m doing all the work.

Another benefit from working with a team, is building on to talents of other teammates.

At MIT I would study programming because I believe that when you program you are essentially creating someone, a person that you can customize and develop as you go along. This person or program can be useful in the lives for many, they might depend on this person to help them in daily tasks such as transportation or even help fight world problems. Some obstacles that might prevent me of achieving my goal would be the intense competition to be the best at programming.

The lesson I learned that day was that you need make the best out of a bad situation or problem.","A time that I struggled in my life was during my freshman and sophomore years of high school.

I thought to myself that I couldn’t keep going on like this so I decided to focus and make my mom proud. Now I can say that I am a better student.

During the time I was there, I worked as both an instructor for the nature merit badge and as a cashier at the Trading Post (the camp store). The main reasons why this summer was important to me is as a boy scout, I have both worked as this camp and was formerly a camper myself. It was interesting to be able see both sides of camp and gain that once in a lifetime experience, and being able to interact with the children and putting to a smile to both their and their parents faces made no matter how rough the job was, all worth it in the end.","Something I recently had to struggled with was finding a way to work the new studio equipment that they had put in my school for the students. What was challenging about it was that the only time you can use it is during lunch, meaning I was working under pressure with something that I knew little about as far as recording goes. That and the fact that other students use the studio made it harder to learn because I was not able to be in their everyday of the week. When trying to learn how to use the equipment, it took plenty of trial and error to finally figure everything out, to the point that the teacher who is in authority of the studio occasionally ask me how to work the equipment, and if I have free time teach the other students how to record and make their own music/podcast.","Whether I am working in a group or by myself is perfectly fine with me as I tend to do both on whatever project I work on.

However, if money wasn't the issue, I would be afraid that higher standards would be required like a higher gpa and sat score. I believe that with dedication and inspiration, you can achieve anything. I've always wanted to major in something where justice is served and the good always comes to those that need it. In other words, I want to help others by getting them out of situations that'll cost them their entire life. Even though people would tell me its worthless or I deserve better, opinions won't matter because they'll not always be by my side.","Out of everything I did last summer, I'd say the most important things that effected me the most was playing the sport of soccer and my trip to Atlantic City. Soccer is a sport that I've had my difficulties with except it's a sport where you use a soccer ball and do tricks with it. It only involves one person and multiple techniques involving creation and control as well as agility. It's important to me since it helped me become more confident in myself and be more active. My trip to Atlantic City helped me bond more with my family because since we're getting older, being distant is something that usually happens. That's why bonding with family is important and it shows that being together is more important than being distant.","In my life, I'll admit that I struggled with a lot of things that's more mentally than physically. Despite all, my experience in a college class was the most difficult. Not only did I have a college teacher, but the class was called critical thinking. This class was meant to open your mind to new possibilities and evaluate things from a different perspective. When I first started, I already knew that this would be a challenge. I couldn't find it in myself to think more than what I usually do, but that didn't stop me from trying. I didn't try at first because I took it for granted, and I paid the price when I failed my midterm. From that moment on, I pushed myself by reaching new height in an upwards trend to a vertical position. For instance, it's crazy that people wouldn't believe in  a certain religion because there isn't enough evidence to support what exactly happened in the past. Furthermore, I passed the college course with a B and became happy to see how a new mind can overcome a college course that's difficult for college students.","I prefer working as part of a team because it gives me the opportunity to meet new people and socialize with people that could bring a huge benefit to my life.

At NYU I would study computer networking, as that is what I'm currently learning, and am really fond of. However, of course money does come into play in achieving this dream, as I do not think my parents would be able to afford the high costs of the school. ","Last summer, in order to fulfill the requirements of my confirmation, I had to attend a retreat, in which I would be gone for two days and stay in a retreat center with hundreds of other kids. During this trip, I attended mass for two days and prayed until they let us go to sleep, which was really late. At the time, I was really annoyed because I was being forced to be there and as soon as I got there, they took away my phone, basically forcing me to be social. However, as time went on, I realized that everything I learned there made me become a better person and helped me grow spiritually, not to mention that I met some really good people there, who I'm still in touch with to this day.","As soon as I saw this question, I was taken back to a couple of months ago when I was struggling heavily in my Critical Thinking College Now course. I thought the course just wasn't for me. In fact, I became so hopeless that I wasn't going to pass the course, that I was prepared to withdraw from the course about half-way in. I discussed my intentions with my professor and he told me that he believed I was a bright kid who could still comfortably pass the course if I give it all my effort. My professor insisted on me staying and that was all I needed, the confidence. My professor's confidence in me led me to giving it my all for the remainder of the course, and like my professor told me, I ended up passing quite comfortably. ","To be completely honest, I prefer working solo. This is mainly due to the fact that I like to challenge myself to get things done on my own, without the help of anyone else.

I want to pursue a career in nuclear engineering because I honestly see a future in nuclear energy. I believe it will be an essential factor in having a clean energy grid, despite it technically being a fossil fuel. But that's where I want to help. I want to join in on the research on fusion reactors which are much cleaner and effective at producing energy. Just the ability to harness the process that powers the sun would be incredible and could replace most power sources. I even dream of powering spacecrafts with a reactor. This would allows us to travel farther in space. Unfortunately the only things that might get in my way or nuclear energy in general isn't me or other researchers or even the concept itself. It's funding and the public. Without funding progress cannot be made and the public don't understand as much as they should. They will oppose it because of fears and misconceptions.","Last summer I had an internship at an agency called ROKO Labs. It gave me something to do over the summer because wasting a summer to me in my high school years seems dumb. I did simple work I guess such looking for bugs in their website, testing out new apps, and researching potential clients for them. I learned what everyone did there and the role they played in the company. It gave me experience in the workplace and an example of how things work in an office. It also gave me an idea of what a job feels like as I had to get there on time, dress properly, and to do extra to make myself look better. It was also something to put on my resume so that's always a plus. ","This year in my AP Language and Composition. This was honestly the first time a class actually stressed/challenged me. I had to think about my work carefully, I couldn't simply do it at the last minute and hope it was good enough. I was expected to do college work for the first time in my life. So I did. What made it more challenging was that we don't get grades on our work. So I had/have to constantly try to improve my writing and work in order to higher my standards so I didn't have to rely on a grading system to improve. ","I honestly prefer working solo. It made seem strange but it just feels better to me. My mind is clearer without others changing my ideas or not contributing anything at all. I've always had a bad experiences with teams and groups.

One tried to help but it became obvious he did not know much. No one was able to come up with any helpful or useful ideas so our presentation was awful in the end. This has happened many times, mostly in school and it gets frustrating when my teammates are lazy and don't want to do anything. Although I will not say group work is bad and that I could never work in teams. I have had great teams before and enjoy the help of others at times.

This trip was very important to me because even though I was enjoying spending time with my family, it showed me how much of an influence technology has on our daily life. There was no internet connection and cellular signal was sparse where we stayed.

However, the most appealing thing about this program is that it's free. I have found other computer science programs in NYC but they are expensive and it is because of this that I am unable to learn something new. Also, this sounds like an amazing experience that I believe can open new doors for me.","If money was no object, I would want to attend a small college in the Northeast region that offers my chosen major. Unfortunately I have yet to decide what college I would like to apply to next year nor have I decided what I would like to major in. However, I do have a list of possible majors which include, political science, theoretical physics, economics, environmental science, criminal justice and/or computer science. Despite my lack of knowledge in computer science I believe it is becoming a popular major because of the increase in high tech jobs and I would love to be a part of that industry. The reason I find the other majors appealing is because I have always enjoyed science and mathematics but I have become more interested in technology the past few months and see it as a better opportunity to eventually earn a high paying job. One obstacle I see that may prevent me from achieving this dream is the cost of college tuition and expenses. My family is far from wealthy and I could never place the burden of a high tuition on my parents so that would mean either going to a lower leveled but cheap college within my area or not attending college at all. I believe that the only chance I have of gaining a proper education is to work hard and try to learn as much as I can inside and outside of school so that if I end up not going to college, I would be at least capable of getting a job. ","Last summer I dedicated my vacation to training for cross country and track in general. I spent all week except Sunday training at a local park with my team. I also attended a camp for runners called The Running School where I spent one week in upstate New York. I was blessed to be able to attend camp because the average price was around $500 however my coach was helpful in getting me a discount of $150. The entire experience was very important to me because it taught me valuable life lessons. The training brought me closer to the sport and to my team but it was at camp where I learned how to become a serious, focused and determined runner and it taught me to never give up. I say this because my week was spent running more than I had ever ran before in my life and it was physically and mentally draining as we trained on huge hills and worked out for most of the day. Afterwards, I gained a passion and love for the sport but I also learned how important teamwork is and how hard work and determination can be push you beyond your limits.","During elementary into middle school I struggled with bullying. It began towards the end of my fourth grade year when a kid I had been friends with humilated me by pulling a prank and began talking about me behind my back. He was a popular kid and so I never stood up to him, instead I choose to ignore him and his friends and just wait it out since we were going to graduate next year. Then in middle school, a kid would constantly pick at me for anything I said or did and would make jokes about me to the entire class. This time around I choose to stand up to him and called him out on his bullying which was enough to end the problem. What was most challenging during this time was the inability to make new friends. Most people would hear things about me and choose to not get to know me. However, I can say that I learned from my mistakes by calling him out in the end and I believe the experience has made me a stronger person.","I prefer to work solo because I learned through track to depend on myself. Running is a team sport but it is all up to you to be faster and work hard to reach your goal. This mix of teamwork and self reliance has led me to become very independent. Also, working solo helps me stay organized and prevents others from taking credit for work they may not have done. Having said all this, I want to make it clear that I understand the benefits of working in a team and would be fine with working with others. Simply put, I believe working as part of a team can be risky since the team may not get along or other conflicts can prevent the team from completing the assignment.

Aldelphi University also has people on staff to help when I’m stuck with anything and they also acknowledge my Individualized Education Program (I.E.P.).  The atmosphere at Aldelphi University is calm and relaxing to me. The only obstacle that would prevent me from achieving going to Adelphi University is not being able to pay for tuition, room and board.","Last summer I went to Savannah, Georgia with my family to visit my Uncle and Great- Grandmother’s grave. I like to visit the sites that I hear my family talking about that has something to do with my family history. This was important to me because my family was one of the families to get 40 Acres and a Mule. My ancestors were also involved in building Saint Bartholomew, the first Black Episcopal Church and schoolhouse in Savannah, Georgia.","When I struggled with Math, I would stay behind and I would get extra help with the subject.

I would choose the California Institute of Technology because it is one of the best schools nationwide for computer science majors and has a very high percentage of graduates receiving jobs upon graduation. I would choose to study computer sciences because I have always found computers very interesting and as such have sought to learn as much as I could about the history and how to interact with them, such as programming. Therefore I feel that studying computer sciences would help further my knowledge and help me for whatever my future career will be. Some obstacles that could prevent me from achieving my dreams are money and distance.","In the summer of 2016 I attended the South Eastern Region Teen Conference.

I was also able to see great speakers which showed me how I could improve my oral presentation. There were also modules that taught us about money management, college preparation, and more. These modules helped me to start preparing for college and to start thinking more about my future and how what I do today will affect my future.

The most challenging part was not just finding a way to incorporate all the classes but finding a way that met all of the requirements in a two-week time period. I dealt with this challenge by doing research on the making of countries, talking to my teachers about ways to apply certain techniques, and by just sitting down and planning it all out.","I prefer working as a team because while I feel that I know a lot, the fact is that there is a lot that I do not know and having a team not only provides me with more info and data, but also with more opinions and ideas.

I mastered this format, and so was earning perfect grades on all of my lab reports. However, this year, my chemistry teacher (who willingly attended college for eighteen years and has worked at various pharmaceutical companies) decided that he would have his students write their lab reports as an organic chemist would. This meant a drastic shift in the structure of the lab, the language used within the lab, and even in minor formatting nuances like centering data tables on a page or writing a procedure that is under seven sentences long. While it was challenging, the lab would not have been near impossible to complete had my teacher provided us with a comprehensive rubric that delineated exactly what was required of us. Unfortunately, since that was not the case, I struggled immensely to unearth what was expected of me and meet each expectation and ultimately earned one of the worst grades I have ever received. Rather than blaming the teacher for the poor grade, I have taken it upon myself to try to better understand him and his expectations and have been meeting each and every one of them ever since.","While I have no objection to collaborating with others, I generally prefer to work solo.

In the beginning of the course, the teachers instructed us to do numerous worksheets and a personality test, outlining our interests. Using the criteria we outlined, we were then able to find colleges that aligned with our interests and map out how we might be able to afford those colleges based on our financial background. At the end of the program we all presented financial plans for attending our dream colleges. This program was very important to me because it helped me gain a much better understanding of how I can afford college, coming from a lower income family, and not struggle with student loans for an extensive period of time. I also really enjoyed the program because I got to make a lot of new friends and go on trips to different business offices, based on our interests, such as Google and Bank of America. Visiting Google was especially interesting to me because we got to speak with one of their design producers and get insight into how they create the layout of the Google homepage website. Furthermore, because our trip to Google was during the time of the Olympics, we were able to learn about how the developers at Google synced the live score feed from Brazil.","One time that I struggled with a subject in school was when I took Accelerated Chemistry in my sophomore year of high school. In the class, we would have to read a portion of the textbook and answer follow up questions for homework. My teacher would grade these homework assignments very hard and initially, I faced difficulty getting good grades on homework assignments in that class. In order to do better on these homework assignments, I started to type up my answers and bring them to class on my school laptop. In class, when we would go over the homework assignments, I would ask clarifying questions for the parts of the homework that I was confused about. After asking those questions and getting a better understanding of the homework, I was able to submit the assignments with correct answers a few hours before they were due, at the end of the school day. As a result of this adjustment, I was able to do much better in Accelerated Chemistry and get an A- for the second semester of that class.","I prefer working as part of a team.

","I prefer working as a team as opposed to working solo. Working as a team is overall more beneficial since more ideas and more work is able to be completed.

I would major in computer technology and physics, as those are two of my favorite subjects in science. I would still plan to make a career in both and make advancements in both fields. As Albert Einstein said, ""Once you stop learning, you start dying."" That is the first and foremost reason for a higher education, money would come after. An obstacle would be income, as I cannot afford to go to any good universities, but that will not prevent me from achieving my dream.","Last summer I read, studied, and did little else. I finally cracked open and completed the college calculus textbook I had received a few years prior, and spent the majority of my time studying and practicing calculus. I read a paper on mathematical proofs by Michael Hutchings, mathematician and professor at Berkeley. I bought and had begun to read books on PHP, C++, and Javascript, however I did not venture too far into coding to call myself an expert; I am still a novice when it comes to coding. Lastly, I discovered that MIT had their lectures online for free and watched and took notes from hours of it, at least equivalent to a full week. I would not have preferred doing the usual summer activities people do, I am disinterested in all of them. This was an important time because, during the school year, I was too busy receiving an education for nine months to learn anything.","The most harrowing time that I have ever struggled with anything occurred last year in early May. I had spent months researching for a single essay for my Global Studies class, called a ""Gateway"" at my school, and not passing the Gateway would mean I had failed the entire class for that year. The topic was on Hitler's rise to power, and I gave what I considered my second best essay at that point, only coming second to an essay on internalized racism for my English class based off the book ""The Bluest Eye"" by Tony Morrison. I turn in my Global Studies Gateway and prepared for what I knew was going to be the most satisfactory summer I had ever had. That was until my Mother told me the exact words, ""I just got off the phone, with Ms. Hussain, and you're failing Global indefinitely. She knows you plagiarized."" I was so stunned I could not speak. My Global teacher said what ""tipped her off"" was the language I used, as she thought a Freshman could write an essay that well and have that large of a vocabulary. These were the things I had worked long and hard for, and what I have been praised for in many previous grades, including the ninth grade. Writing had never come easy for me, but through so much effort I had become so good at essay writing that in the eighth grade I took a test determining that I wrote above 96% of college students. I was much better than that in Freshman year. That being used against me was something I had never thought of, and it irritated me. Another thing that had irritated me about that was my progress in the class; I had 103% in Global Studies in the first month, and the lowest my grades had gotten before that point was a 96%. What made me almost give up, however, was my teachers lack of evidence that I had plagiarized, and all the evidence to the contrary. My teacher never showed myself nor my mother the source she believes I plagiarized my essay from. People, be it friends at school or my mother at home, had seen me working on my essay. Yet even my own mother did not believe my side. I did not give up, however. I stopped trying to prove my innocence, I was a Freshman trying to convince an experienced teacher who teaches English to Seniors that she was wrong. Even though it still frustrates me almost a year later, I instead made a plea bargain; I would ""admit"" to plagiarism, write two Gateway essay's on a topic other than Hitler's rise to power, and, if those two essays passed, the highest score I could get for Global Studies was a 65%, passing by the skin of my teeth. I wrote the essays on both World War II and Nazi Germany, so that all my months of research would not be wasted. They were not near the quality of my first Gateway essay, but I turned them in, received my 65%, and the rest will one day be history.","Although this would normally be the ill-advised answer, I prefer working solo to working as part of a team. Working solo would not guarantee my work succeeds or fails, that is based on my own merits and work ethic. Working as a team usually means my work ends up failing because the work ethic of others, and experience has taught me that most people do not even have a work ethic. Other than the work ethic, communication, a tool civilizations had used before language itself to survive and prosper, has become a lost art. I have noticed people will often refuse to listen to me, even if I were right about a topic, while others will take over a team's work as their own, leaving my opinion lost to the wind. Some team members will refuse to work at all if the team does not work their way, which would normally be labelled as very childish, but I cannot label it that way because I did not behave in that manner as a child. My final grievance against working as a team would have to be the social aspect. In school, for example, I would just want myself and my team to finish the work the best way it could be finished and nothing more, but people will want to spend half of our time trying to get to know me, since I do not go out of my way to make friends among my peers, making friends is more of an accident for me than anything else. I am not a very social person, more of an introvert than anything, but I will not refuse to make conversation. It is when peers that I must interactive try to talk personal, perhaps as friends, that I start to dislike working with a team. I do find it amusing, however, when someone sees me being non social in a social setting and takes that as an invitation to be social towards me, usually saying ""You do not talk much,"" and then tries to initiate a conversation. With all that being said, I am neither incapable nor unwilling to work as part of a team, I just prefer to work solo.",3/17/2017 9:29pm,3/20/2017 11:59pm,Yes,,1,0,2,120+126+115,,3,Rejected,,,4,10th grade,"Hispanic/Latino, Caribbean",,,Bronx Lab School,,Yes,Yes,,Public,Bronx,Not sure,Natalie,(347) 595-8752,Reyes,

Secondly, for the military I feel that it would make me into a stronger, smarter, disciplined, and a more dependable individual. And after my years in the service, when I come back home. I will try to join the police department, since I will have the experience and understanding of what's going on, and I will have the military to back me up.

At this point in my life, while I have narrowed the list down, I am still not entirely sure what I want to do in life. The two things that I can see myself studying is business or computer engineering. When I go to college, I want to have the freedom to carefully experience everything that I have an interest in and have an accurate depiction of how life in that particular field will be like. I want to go to a school like Columbia or Hampshire where I am encouraged to explore all different types of professions. One obstacle I will face is the competitive nature of the college application process. There might be people better equip or more suitable to go to Columbia than I am but no matter where I end up, I will try my best to explore all my passions and come to a conclusion on what my profession would be. ","My family is very business centric, and with that comes along many errands and things that need to get done. Over the summer, even going on till this date, I have written and printed many documents, organize and file papers, and send many e-mails to my family. These are all activities that are important to me because when I do them, I feel important. I feel like that what I am is doing is significant and holds meaning. Due to my knowledge of the English language and use of computers, I am usually the first one members of my family would come to whether it be problems with school, housing, citizenship, or their job. Helping my family is important to me and because of that, I find pleasure in running errands for them. ","Before high school, I attended Catholic school my entire life. Due to this, it was very easy for me to practice my faith as it was sort of a requirement. When I started high school and as given a little more freedom on the things I choose to and not to do, I found myself rarely practicing my faith. Some part was because my school is episcopalian but also I was not willing to practice it as I wanted to use that time to do something else. This part of my life had me think to myself a lot but I resulted to a conclusion. Even though I can’t practice my Catholic religion due to the conflict in my school, I still have my personal faith and whether I decided to go to church or not shouldn't affect that faith. As long as I have my beliefs, I will be alright as I don’t have to prove myself to anybody else.  ","Before, I was able to easily work by myself or as a part of a team and not find any correlation with that and the results. As I got older, I started to see the importance of teamwork and why it is better than working solo. Working as a team means that you have many other people that have strengths and weaknesses and you can help develop one another. Working as a team also means you have other perspectives when combatting a problem. You have access to other sources of knowledge rather than yourself than can help especially when trying to resolve something. Being a part of a team is better overall which is why I prefer it rather than working by myself.

Psychology because I feel as though I form good connections with people and I enjoy helping those around me through experiences I'm knowledgeable in or even if I haven't been through a certain situation I can still give advice. I've just always found it interesting how people act differently from one another. They could be brought up in the same situations but act completely different. I'm mainly interested in counseling because I believe the best way to help people is through people. If we allow those struggling to continue to fend for themselves and possibly sink deeper, then we are not advancing as a community.","Last summer I spent a majority of my time with my family and my girlfriend, because during the year I was living with my uncle, hoping that a different environment will assist in my success. Throughout the time, I was mainly with my dad practicing the skills he had taught me over the course of my childhood. My father has done a bunch of construction work, to the point where he doesn't really need a team of people when he can literally do just about everything himself. It was important to me because it brought back the bond we had had. It was especially important to me because it allowed for me to show my girlfriend a man I aspire to be like one day.","I can talk to you all about something I continue to struggle with, sadly. Everyone has their off days, where they just don't or can't put in as much effort as they usually do. Most people are capable of keeping their work lives separate from their actual lives outside of the work place. I can't do this too well. At school I focus too much on whats going on in my life instead of my future. As much as I hear and know that everything going on currently is temporary and high school is just for now. I can't take the steps I need to focus on whats best for me. Instead of investing all of myself into me. I give my all to those I love and I try to better them. My girlfriend for example, me and her have had many ups and downs but whenever something comes up I try pleasing her or I focus on how we aren't perfect at the moment and I get down on myself to the point where I just shut down.  Current;y, I'm trying to just push these thoughts away until an appropriate time arises for me to deal with it.","Honestly, it depends. But for the most part I prefer a team. With a team you can divide and conquer. Its just faster paced if you separate the work and come back together to discuss and inform one another of whats going on. Lets say you run a business like a super market. You can't stock the shelves, be a cashier, clean the aisles and make orders all at the same time. Another reason why I lean more towards teams is that I naturally get nominated as leader, but even then I try to involve everyone as much as possible and make it seem as though its a team decision or team success whenever something is done.",3/20/2017 11:47pm,3/20/2017 11:59pm,Yes,,2,0,1,104+134+108,,3,Rejected,,,3,10th grade,"African American, West Indian",,,KIPP NYC College Prep,,Yes,Yes,,Charter,Brooklyn,Yes,Chenica,(718) 413-6644,Lee,

My reason for saying this is because as a school I know that MIT has many opportunities for up and coming engineers and programmers. Not only do they teach multiple engineering and coding courses, but they also have certain programs working with them, in which you can get access to a well paying job after multiple weeks of learning. Of course I would try to do better than this and get a much better job, but this would be a good start for someone like me while in college.","Last summer, I went on a prep 9 retreat, where we learned about multiple aspects of our society and how we, as students who are privileged enough to go to excellent boarding schools, should try and use our power and position to teach those of the upper class about the working class and those who struggle with everyday things due to discrimination. I found this program very moving, and it has influenced me to join multiple racial awareness groups in our school, and many Esso clubs. Esso clubs are clubs made for the purpose of helping better our society and community at Exeter. This retreat definitely made a lasting impact on me and would probably influence the decisions I make once I get older.","Once in a filmmaking class, we were doing our final projects and I was paired up with a younger student in our class. Although this was a group project, I noticed after a week that I was the one doing most of the work on the project and my partner was purposefully not doing what he was supposed to do. I didn't let this phase me as I continued working on the project, and even went out of my way to a lot of my partners work. It turns out he was struggling in one of his classes and really needed the class time to work on the project. After he had managed to get a footing he started working more on the project and we were able to get an A on the final project.","I prefer to work as part of a team, simply because working with a community makes the project much easier and helps make new friends.

My parents are encouraging me to continue.  When I read about this program I thought this could be helpful for me.","My dream is to attend the University of California at Los Angeles to study engineering or business. I really enjoy the engineering course I am enrolled in at Teaneck High School.  I did well in advanced placement computer science I but did not enjoy it.  I decided to enroll in the engineering course instead of advanced placement computer science II.   It’s a senior level class and I look forward to school each day that I have this course.  I was accepted into the Technology-Enriched Academy for Mathematics and Science (T.E.A.M.S.) at my high school as a freshman. It is a special honors program for motivated students interested in pursuing an integrated study of mathematics, science, computer science and engineering.

My obstacles to attend my dream school are finances and my ability to complete the high level courses required for engineering.  My parents are great but have limited income and have assisted my two older siblings who have graduated college and are now independent professionals. In the next five years they still have me and my two younger siblings to assist through college. My goal is to achieve an academic, baseball and music scholarship.

I’m a centerfielder for my high school varsity baseball team and have played on several travel teams since age 10.  I also am a musician, I play clarinet and several different saxophones. Baseball and music are my outlets…so I must attend a school that has both types of programs. 
","Last summer I was excited to get selected to the LEAD Goldman Sachs LaunchPAD Business Program. As high school juniors, we lived at New York University and were exposed to campus living, the college experience, introductory business courses from NYU professors, and mentors from Goldman Sachs employees.  I honestly had never heard of Goldman Sachs and my parents just told me to complete the application and I’m so glad I listened and was selected.  It really exposed me to business and now I am very interested in some type of computer science, engineering or business career.  I hope to find a career where I could use all three skills.

In addition to the program at NYU, I took the most amazing trip with my family across country by train.  I was fascinating.  We stopped in so many cities and saw so many amazing sites.  The train had historians giving us information about different areas that we traveled through.  On one train I started talking to an African American gentleman and found out he was an engineer for Amtrak.  That was like a dream because I have loved trains since I was a little kid and wanted to be a train engineer at one time. This 6000 mile 30 day trip was awesome.  While on the west coast…we spent a week at UCLA for the Special Olympics and that is when I feel in love with the UCLA.  My mom used to live in California, so it was great having her show us around and meet her great friends. I realized I need to be successful to live the lifestyle that I was exposed to on this trip.  I think the All Star Code program would look great on my resume and college applications and hopefully help me become more confident in my coding skills so I can pursue my dreams.
","I call myself a work in progress.  I struggle every day with my self-confidence and some people call me a perfectionist. In 4th grade I struggled with homework, staying focused and on task.  I was fortunate to have a teacher, African American female. She was determined to see me succeed.  In 5th grade, I got anxious and shut down while taking a standardized test. My teacher thought I was being disrespectful because I started reading a book and contacted my parents.  In 6th grade, my teacher contacted my parents and requested I be evaluated by the child study team because he saw me struggling and feeling anxious during a major test.  They determined that I suffered from test anxieties.  My 6th grade teacher told my parents that I was a potential civic leader and all my classmates looked up to me so not to be discouraged.  I just don’t need time constraints.

My middle school principal suggested I take honors and advanced placement courses in high school and I was terrified.  I have done real well according to my guidance counselor, teacher, friends and my parents but I feel like I could do better.  I recently found out I am ranked in the top 15% of my high school class. Even though my GPA is 4.1 I really couldn’t believe it.

I strive for excellence with my schoolwork, baseball and music. My parents have tried to expose me to different things and have told me to focus on all that I have accomplished when I start to beat myself up.  They encouraged me to play an instrument and in the last 6 years have learned to play 6 different instruments. I won several awards and played in several high level bands. They encouraged me to train in Karate and after 7 years of training recently achieved my first degree black belt.  They encouraged me to play baseball and I played on high level travel teams and hope to play in college.  

The one thing that I’m still working on is accepting my anxiety that allows me extra time on assignments and standardized tests. It is very difficult for me to ask for extra time or advocate for myself.  To me, it makes me feel very different from everyone else.  So this is a struggle for me that I am working on every day. It is very rare that I need extra time on tests or assignments. I know I am intelligent and am an excellent student and writer.  I glad I have a great support team and when I really look at what I have accomplished it’s pretty amazing.
",I prefer working on a team because you can learn a lot from other people.  Many of my honors courses require teamwork for many of our assignments.   I am a part of study groups for my high school courses and a course I am currently taking at Rutgers Business School. Learning to be a part of a team is a requirement playing baseball and as a band member.  I will admit it was challenging at first to be patient with those who didn’t seem to be as passionate as me but I’m glad I learned to be patient and help others at a younger age.

Some of the obstacles preventing me from attending MIT is not being able to afford tutors for SAT II practice and the very low acceptance rate of students accepted by MIT, especially those who apply to MIT for Computer Science.","Last summer, I went to Ohio to visit my uncles. My uncles owned a gas station, and I was there to help them with some tasks around the station, like cleaning up the floors, sorting out the products in the store, and registering products on their computers. It was important to me because I wanted to be a part of my uncle’s success story, as the new gas station business has made huge profits for them and their households. It is also important to me because my uncles are my family, and an ideal family should help each other out whenever possible.","One time I struggled with something was completing a major assignment at a Computer Science Class. We are supposed to make a project by ourselves where users put in a sentence and the program determines if the sentence works according to English sentence rules. It was challenging because I had to use multiple different concepts of code to make one functioning program. In order to accomplish this, I looked over my notes, asked for help understanding the more complicated concepts, and kept persevering through the task.","I prefer working as part of a team. This is because with a proper team, we could distribute the weight of the project based on who can do which part of the project the most efficiently. With proper communication skills, we could easily check the progress of the other team’s work and sort out any issues if necessary. If I worked solo, I would have a huge project over my shoulders, and it would be more difficult to put in the amount of work similar to that of a functioning team.",3/20/2017 7:01pm,3/20/2017 11:59pm,Yes,,2,2,1,112+135+125,,5,Rescinded application,,Rescinded application,4,11th grade,African American,,,School of the Future High School,,Yes,Yes,,Public,New York City,Yes,Asmeret,(646) 895-7792,Mekonnen,

I am very interested in coding and I am already taking a coding course at Bloomberg. I hope to broaden my horizons through this six week program.,"If money were no object, for college I would go to MIT. MIT is a school fixated on the development and advancement of new technology. Students from the college have already released multiple different forms of new technology. The school is one of the pioneers for what will become our future. I would like to be a part of that movement and reach towards the stars. I would like to study engineering along with coding. Coding and engineering will be carpentry of the future. It will be the new building blocks in developing inventions to change the world. One obstacle that will prevent me from completing my dream is my perfectionist attitude. I always try to make everything perfect. This causes me to take away precious time from other important tasks. This causes my grades and test to misrepresent my actual capability. This has also hindered my progress. I need to fix this character in my trait so I can achieve this goal of goin to MIT.","Last summer I was involved in an Entrepreneurship program with google. We were tasked with creating a business presentation and pitching it to members of the google staff. We competed to win around one thousand dollars in prize money. This was important to me because it allowed me to develop my own dream of creating a website that combines that social community of facebook and the streaming services of Netflix. This was my dream in the program and I still want to develop this now. However, I did not win and I learned from this program which made it important to me. I learned that I need to practice my presentation skills and not lend fear take over my life.  I also was able to finalize my goal to create a website.","In my Advanced Physics class, we were tasked with analyzing and recreating an Ozone generator. I was having a hard time understanding the mechanics and multiple moving parts of the machine. I kept on looking over and testing the machine but I could not understand how it worked. To solve this problem, I sat down and talked with my group members.  Together, we drew up a small design of the machine. We then drew different sections of the machine and analyzed the different sections and how each interacted with the others. We then wrote one cohesive step by step plan of how the machine works. By taking apart the machine, step by step with my group, I was able to understand the concept as a whole. ","I prefer working as a group. When I work alone I am very fast and I get a lot done. However, the end result tends to be messy and I am the only one capable of understanding my design. However, by working with a group I get less done because I am limited but accelerated by my group members. However, the end result is easily easy to read and understand, it is meaningful and in a group I can take the next step.

I also just want to expand my horizons and see if coding is something I would enjoy.","Frankly, I don't have a specific college that I am currently looking at, even though I should at this point, but would I attend an Ivy League University? Probably not. Why? I feel like there is more to a college than its name. Everyone dreams of going to Harvard or Yale, and to be honest so have I, but I strive to be a Civil Engineer when I grow up and I value going to a school with a strong engineering program rather than just a huge endowment. It's kind of like that movie, Good Will Hunting, but trust me, I'm not planning on being a Janitor at MIT, and I still value a college education. Right now, I feel like the only obstacle is myself, and I am constantly improving in order to perfect myself, although I know in essence nobody really is.  ","Last summer, I participated in a program called Rescuing Leftover Cuisine, a nonprofit organization which gathers fresh food that would otherwise go into the trash from places like Starbucks or your local bakery, and takes that food to a homeless shelter and donates that food. Although I may be considered unprivileged, I beg to differ. I have a house, a family, and go to a great school, and I feel like giving back to my community and helping  the ones who don't have the opportunities I do. I've been doing this for 2 to 3 years now, and don't plan on stopping. ","After, adjusting into my new school after transferring, I struggled. This wasn't just a transfer to another school on another street. I transferred from John Bowne High School in Flushing, NY to St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, 260 miles away, away from my friends and my family, and away from a a group of people I could identify with. 

Ultimately what I did was be myself, and I soon realized that the preconceptions I had about the new environment I was going to live in were completely wrong. Although I adjusted socially, I suffered academically. My straight A's soon turned to low A's and then to B's. I consulted my adviser and soon got back on track. ","I always considered myself as more of a ""solo"" person, but after being part of the Robotics team this year, and the Wrestling team at my school, I realized the importance of teamwork and camaraderie. I feel like I can alternate between both whenever I have to, and I believe that to be one of my valuable assets. I feel like coding is more of a solo job, but maybe being part of a team can help in developing our coding skills as it promotes conferring with others and using other's successes as models to improve your own faults.
